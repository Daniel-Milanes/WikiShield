Striped hog-nosed skunk,"The striped hog-nosed skunk (Conepatus semistriatus) is a skunk species from Central and South America (from southern Mexico to northern Peru, and in the extreme east of Brazil).  This species of skunk is considered a generalist species, because they are able to thrive in, and withstand, disturbed environmental conditions. They can live in a wide range of habitats, including carrasco, arboreal caatinga, mango orchard, and dry forest scrub and occasionally, in rainforest.

Charles Foster (New York politician),"Charles Foster (September 2, 1823 – May 23, 1877) was an American lawyer and politician.
Foster, son of Nathaniel and Elizabeth Foster, was born in Lansingburgh, Rensselaer County, on September 2, 1823. In 1836, his parents moved to Pompey, Onondaga County, where he prepared for college. He graduated from Yale College in 1844. He studied law with Hon. Victor Birdseye, of Pompey; Hon. B. D. Noxon, of Syracuse; and Hon. John Van Buren, of Albany. In October 1847, he was admitted to the bar, but due to health issues, he was advised to pursue a more active life. He worked in the cattle trade until January 1853, when he began practicing law in Cortland, N. Y., where he remained until his death.
On October 13, 1853, he married Jane M., daughter of Richard G. Fowler, of Cortland. They had no children.
He partnered with R. H. Duell from January 1857 until 1874, when failing health forced him to retire from his profession. He had suffered from pulmonary problems for several years and spent the following three winters in Washington, but without significant improvement. From November 1875 to February 1877, he was employed as an examiner in the U. S. Patent Office. He died of consumption in Cortland on May 23, 1877, at the age of 53. In addition to local offices of trust, the only public position he held was member of the New York State Assembly in the 1870.",2885,"Category:1823 births;Category:1877 deaths;Category:19th-century American lawyers;Category:19th-century members of the New York State Legislature;Category:All articles lacking sources;Category:Articles lacking sources from May 2025;Category:Articles with hCards;Category:Articles with short description;Category:Members of the New York State Assembly;Category:New York (state) lawyers;Category:Pages using infobox person with multiple parents;Category:People from Cortland, New York;Category:People from Lansingburgh, New York;Category:Short description is different from Wikidata;Category:Yale College alumni",25,2015-07-09T22:25:43Z,2025-05-15T02:22:59Z,8233,1290482778,2025-05-15T02:22:59Z,http://mssa.library.yale.edu/obituary_record/;https://www.jstor.org/action/doBasicSearch?Query=%22Charles+Foster%22+New+York+politician&acc=on&wc=on;https://www.google.com/search?as_eq=wikipedia&q=%22Charles+Foster%22+New+York+politician;https://www.google.com/search?tbm=nws&q=%22Charles+Foster%22+New+York+politician+-wikipedia&tbs=ar:1;https://www.google.com/search?&q=%22Charles+Foster%22+New+York+politician&tbs=bkt:s&tbm=bks;https://www.google.com/search?tbs=bks:1&q=%22Charles+Foster%22+New+York+politician+-wikipedia;https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22Charles+Foster%22+New+York+politician,تشارلز فوستر,Cydebot;Ser Amantio di Nicolao;Gamaliel;FrescoBot;Ewulp;Jevansen;MensanDeltiologist;Kraxler;Engineerchange;PjJnep;NatFee;Jaiquiero;Faizenprime,Charles Foster;Daniel Gott;Henry S.

Typically, the patterns of pits and scratches on the occlusal or buccal surface of the enamel are compared with patterns observed in extant species to infer ecological information. Hard foods in particular can lead to distinctive patterns (although see below). Microwear can also be used for inferring behavior, especially those related to the non-masticatory use of teeth as 'tools'. Other uses include investigating weaning in past populations. Methods used to collect data initially involved a microscope and manually collecting information on individual microwear features, but software to automatically collect data have improved markedly in recent years.

Herring Island (Victoria),"Herring Island is a small 3.2 hectares (7.9 acres) artificial island located in Melbourne's Yarra River at South Yarra, approximately 3 kilometres (1.9 mi) from the city centre. It is the only island in the Yarra River.
Herring Island was formed in 1928 by cutting a channel through an old basalt quarry. The island was leased for many years by the scout movement, who named it after their patron, Sir Edmund Herring, the Lieutenant-Governor of Victoria and Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Victoria. The Island contains indigenous vegetation, and provides important habitat for native fauna, particularly birds. It is currently managed by Parks Victoria and used as a sculpture park.

Minimum ignition energy,"The minimum ignition energy (MIE) is a safety characteristic in explosion protection and prevention which determines the ignition capability of fuel-air mixtures, where the fuel may be combustible vapor, gas or dust.  It is defined as the minimum electrical energy stored in a capacitor, which, when discharged, is sufficient to ignite the most ignitable mixture of fuel and air under specified test conditions. The MIE is one of the assessment criteria for the effectiveness of ignition, e.g. the discharge of electrostatic energy, mechanical ignition sources or electromagnetic radiation. It is an important parameter for the design of the protective measure of ""avoidance of effective ignition sources"".",1571,Category:All stub articles;Category:Chemical process stubs;Category:Chemical reaction stubs;Category:Combustion;Category:Energy stubs;Category:Safety,38,2009-01-15T19:30:01Z,2023-12-26T17:44:56Z,84121,1191932638,2025-05-22T03:26:17Z,https://staubex.ifa.dguv.de/HTML-Dokumente/ERLT8E.HTM;https://web.archive.org/web/20190902120011/https://staubex.ifa.dguv.de/HTML-Dokumente/ERLT8E.HTM;https://web.archive.org/web/20210815123308/https://downloadcenter.bgrci.de/resource/downloadcenter/downloads/R003_Gesamtdokument.pdf;https://downloadcenter.bgrci.de/resource/downloadcenter/downloads/R003_Gesamtdokument.pdf,Mindestzündenergie;最小着火エネルギー;Minimalna energija paljenja;最小點火能,"AnomieBOT;Fadesga;Andy Dingley;Addbot;John B123;Ehrenkater;GoingBatty;Shoefly;Me, Myself, and I are Here;Anna Frodesiak;Tony1;GreenC bot;SporkBot;Life of Riley;Jonkerz;ErikHaugen;Steveprutz;Curbon7;WikiCleanerBot;Ensahequ;Jcaiken;Steffen 962;TL;Cedelmwood;Trex4321",Burning glass;Combustion;Torch;Flint;Match;Bow drill;Bonfire;Campfire;Static electricity;Fire pit;Autoignition temperature;Lighter;Tinder;Firewood;Wood fuel;Tinderbox;Slow match;Black match;Matchbook;Fire making

Murrumbidgee District,"The Murrumbidgee District was a district (also called a squatting district, pastoral district or grazing district) used in New South Wales in the nineteenth century to refer to the land between the Murrumbidgee River and Murray River, that is now mostly known as the Riverina region. Some maps show the district included the parts of what is now the Australian Capital Territory that was to the west of the Murrumbidgee River.  The district was originally one of the districts used to refer to the area outside the limits of location, but later continued to be used as the name after counties were proclaimed within this area. It went out of use after 1884, when new districts were proclaimed.
In 1841 it had a population of 1139, with 180,654 sheep and 62,848 cattle, 1517 horses, with 1,795 acres (7 km2) in cultivation and 147 stations, according to an 1841 map.
In 1843 it had a population of 1463, with 226,682 sheep, 93,458 cattle, 2315 horses, 2,400 acres (10 km2) in cultivation and 172 stations.
In 1852 the district included 12 million acres (49,000 km2) total, with 400,000 sheep, 100,000 cattle and 3,000 horses
Early maps show the eastern boundary of the district being the Murrumbidgee River, while an 1871 map shows the eastern boundary being the Goodradigbee River, with the Monaro district in the area between the Goodradigbee and the Murrumbidgee.
It comprised the area of the counties of Wakool, Townsend, Cadell, Denison, Urana, Hume, Goulburn, Wynyard, Mitchell, Selwyn, Buccleuch and part of Caira and Waradgery.",3818,Category:All Wikipedia articles written in Australian English;Category:Articles with short description;Category:History of New South Wales;Category:Short description matches Wikidata;Category:Use Australian English from February 2018;Category:Use dmy dates from February 2018;Category:Webarchive template archiveis links,13,2007-08-28T02:25:30Z,2024-03-30T09:17:55Z,16058,1216309239,2025-05-08T16:19:15Z,http://nla.gov.au/nla.map-nk5348;http://www.oldwelshbooks.net/hlc/ga/ga07.html;http://nla.gov.au/nla.map-rm1669;http://nla.gov.au/nla.map-rm3062;http://nla.gov.au/nla.map-rm881;http://nla.gov.au/nla.map-f62;https://archive.today/20070527081324/http://www.oldwelshbooks.net/hlc/ga/ga07.html,,InternetArchiveBot;SmackBot;Rjwilmsi;Lightbot;Redrose64;Coolabahapple;Lightmouse;Bhadani;CoolieCoolster;Roke;AussieLegend2;Rlink2,Murrumbidgee;Riverina;Frederick Walker (native police commandant);Australian native police;Lands administrative divisions of New South Wales;User:AlexNewArtBot/AustraliaSearchResult/archive10;Talk:Murrumbidgee District;All That Swagger;Border Police of New South Wales;User:Gemgemyellowgem/sandbox;Jacob John Halley;List of Australian tornadoes

Curse: The Eye of Isis,"Curse: The Eye of Isis is a survival horror video game that was developed by British studio Asylum Entertainment and published by DreamCatcher Interactive and Wanadoo for the Xbox, PlayStation 2 and Windows. It was released stateside for Windows in October 2003 and for Xbox in April 2004. The PlayStation 2 version was only released in Europe.
It shares the same sort of atmospheric setting, gameplay, fixed camera angles, and ammo preservation as the earlier Resident Evil games, as well as many other archetypal survival horror games in the genre, such as ObsCure and Silent Hill.
The Xbox version of the game was very briefly backwards compatible with the Xbox 360, but was removed from the list because of glitches on December 1, 2005.

Grant Richards (publishing house),"Grant Richards was a small British publishing house founded in 1897 by the writer Grant Richards.
Significant publications from the company's first incorporation were George Bernard Shaw's Plays Pleasant and Unpleasant and A. E. Housman's A Shropshire Lad, as well as books by G. K. Chesterton, Saki, Arnold Bennett, Samuel Butler, and Ernest Bramah.
In 1897, the Grant Richards publishing house began publishing the Dumpy Books for Children series of small format books for children.
In 1901, the publishing house launched The World's Classics, a reprint series of out of copyright literary classics. In 1905, the series was acquired by Henry Frowde of Oxford University Press, which continues to publish the series as Oxford World's Classics.
Richards declared bankruptcy in 1905. He reorganised and continued to run the firm, publishing first under the name of E. Grant Richards (which included the initial of his wife's first name) and then under the name of Grant Richards Ltd. In these years the firm published works by John Galsworthy, Royall Tyler, James Joyce, Robert Tressell, John Masefield, and Jack Kahane.
In 1926, when Richards declared bankruptcy a second time, the firm was renamed as the Richards Press. In 1937, the firm was bought by Martin Secker. It was subsequently bought by John Baker and finally by A & C Black.",5176,Category:1897 establishments in the United Kingdom;Category:All stub articles;Category:Book publishing companies of the United Kingdom;Category:Publishing companies established in 1897;Category:United Kingdom publishing company stubs;Category:Use dmy dates from April 2022,48,2017-10-18T19:39:59Z,2025-05-22T11:17:21Z,12679,1291619667,2025-05-22T11:17:21Z,http://norman.hrc.utexas.edu/Watch/fob_search_results_next.cfm?FOBFirmName=G&locSTARTROW=51;http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780198606536.001.0001/acref-9780198606536-e-5295;http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780192806871.001.0001/acref-9780192806871-e-8212;https://d-nb.info/gnd/1069399353;https://viaf.org/viaf/315121182;http://www.oxforddnb.com.sl.nsw.gov.au/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-47449;https://www.biblio.com/publisher/grant-richards;https://www.publishinghistory.com/grant-allens-historical-guides-grant-richards.html;https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q46996021#identifiers;https://seriesofseries.com/omar-series/;https://seriesofseries.com/worlds-classics/;https://search.worldcat.org/search?q=%22Grant+Richards%22+%2B+%22Children's+Library%22&offset=1;https://search.worldcat.org/search?q=se:Larger%20dumpy%20books%20for%20children;https://seriesofseries.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/The_Review_of_Reviews_vol24_1901.pdf,,Philip Cross;Vycl1994;Tom.Reding;BrownHairedGirl;Rodw;Antiquary;Iridescent;Perseus25;Monkbot;Thesoulofdiscretion,Richard Wagner;The Way of All Flesh;Grant Allen;Ernest Bramah;The Story of Little Black Sambo;The Ragged-Trousered Philanthropists;Lobster Thermidor;Five Plays;The Wallet of Kai Lung;The Black Mask;A Jubilee Present;Christiana Herringham;Erewhon Revisited;Salt-Water Poems and Ballads;Grant Richards (actor);User:Perseus25;No Sinecure;Talk:Grant Richards (publishing house);The Fate of Faustina;The Last Laugh (short story)

List of 19th-century iron smelting operations in Australia,"This is a list of 19th-century iron smelting operations in Australia.
The earliest commercial iron ore smelting took place in 1848.  There was an increase in pig iron prices in the early 1870s, which led to the formation of a number of colonial-era iron-making ventures in Australia.  A world-wide shortage caused the price of imported pig-iron to increase, from £4 10s per ton in 1870 to £9 per ton in 1873 greatly advantaging locally manufactured iron. This period has been called, 'Australia's age of iron.' However, the high prices did not last long, as global iron-making capacity increased, and pig-iron was once again imported cheaply as ballast in sailing ships returning from England to Australia.

Condensed aerosol fire suppression,"Condensed aerosol fire suppression is a particle-based method of fire extinction. It is similar to but not identical to dry chemical fire extinction methods, using an innovative pyrogenic, condensed aerosol fire suppressant. It is a highly effective fire suppression method for class A, B, C, E and F (as is the case for most fire-extinguishing agents, it is not applicable to metal fires – class D). Some aerosol-generating compounds (e.g., potassium nitrate-based) produce a corrosive by-product that may damage electronic equipment, although later generations lower the effect.
Condensed aerosol fire suppression systems employ a fire-extinguishing agent consisting of very finely divided solid particles, suspended in an inert gas. Those superfine aerosol particles are pyrotechnically generated via the combustion of an aerosol-forming agent (AFA) which is stable at room temperature and does not need to be stored in a pressurized container.
Benefits include high performance (3 times more effective than banned Halon 1301, with the aerosol leveraging both cooling, dilution and chemical inhibition), general availability (from plant-size systems to compact and lightweight portable tooling), low toxicity, environmentally friendliness (e.g., 0% ozone depleting potential), non-pressurized systems, and overall cost-effectiveness.",26262,Category:All Wikipedia articles in need of updating;Category:All articles needing additional references;Category:All articles to be expanded;Category:All articles with style

Dar al-hijra,"The term dār al-hijra (Arabic: دار الهجرة, lit. 'place of exile/refuge/migration') was originally applied to Medina, the city where Muhammad and his followers sought refuge when exiled from Mecca in 622 (Hijrah). The term was accordingly later adopted by radical Islamic sects, most notably the Isma'ilis, for their strongholds, which were to serve both as bases of operations and as nuclei of 'true' Islamic communities.

Titania (A Midsummer Night's Dream),"Titania () is a character in William Shakespeare's 1595–1596 play A Midsummer Night's Dream.
In the play, she is the Queen of the fairies and wife of the Fairy King, Oberon. The pair are depicted as powerful natural spirits who together guarantee the fertility or health of the human and natural worlds. Yet their falling out has severely disrupted both worlds, as Titania explains at length in Act 1 Scene 2, ending ""And this same progeny of evils comes From our debate, from our dissension.""

Reock degree of compactness,"The Reock degree of compactness, or Reock compactness score, is a ratio that quantifies the compactness of the geographic area of a voting district. The score is sometimes used as an indication of the extent to which a voting district may be considered gerrymandered.
The Reock compactness score is computed by dividing the area of the voting district by the area of the smallest circle that would completely enclose it.

It was the 30th annual Royal Rumble and took place on January 29, 2017, at the Alamodome in San Antonio, Texas, held for wrestlers from the promotion's Raw and SmackDown brand divisions. This was the fourth Royal Rumble to be held in the state of Texas, after the 1989 (Houston), 1997 (at the same venue), and 2007 (also in San Antonio) events.
Traditionally, the Royal Rumble match winner receives a world championship match at that year's WrestleMania. However, due to the brand split that was reintroduced in July 2016, the winner received a match for their respective brand's world championship at WrestleMania 33, either Raw's WWE Universal Championship or SmackDown's WWE Championship. The main event was the 2017 Royal Rumble match, which was won by SmackDown's Randy Orton, who last eliminated Raw's Roman Reigns. This made Orton the seventh multiple Royal Rumble winner.
Seven other matches were contested at the event, including three on the Kickoff pre-show. One of the more notable matches saw John Cena defeat AJ Styles to capture his record 13th WWE Championship and his 16th overall world championship, tying Ric Flair's official record. Also on the undercard, Kevin Owens retained the WWE Universal Championship against Roman Reigns in a no disqualification match, Charlotte Flair retained the Raw Women's Championship against Bayley, and Neville defeated Rich Swann to win the WWE Cruiserweight Championship.
It was also the last time that only the men's Royal Rumble match took place as the women's Royal Rumble match was introduced the following year.",77414,Category:2017 WWE Network events;Category:2017

At the time of the [[American Civil War]], Petersburg was the second largest city in the state.  Its 1860 population was 18,266, half of whom were black.  Free blacks numbered 3,224 or one-third, attracted to the city for the job opportunities in industries and trades.<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/history/crdi/publications/HM14.pdf ""National Register Nominations: Pocahontas Island Historic District""], ''Heritage Matters'', Jan-Feb 2008, National Park Service, accessed 30 December 2008</ref>  The Petersburg population had the highest percentage of free blacks of any city in the Confederacy and the largest number of free blacks in the Mid-Atlantic.<ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1546/is_n3_v9/ai_15495032/pg_1?tag=artBody;col1 Henry Chase, ""Proud, free and black: Petersburg - visiting the Virginia location of the largest number of 19th century free [blacks&#93;""], ''American Visions'', Jun-Jul 1994, accessed 27 December 2008</ref>  Many free blacks had settled on [[Pocahontas Island, Virginia|Pocahontas Island]].<ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1546/is_n3_v9/ai_15495032/pg_1?tag=artBody;col1 Henry Chase, ""Proud, free and black: Petersburg - visiting the Virginia location of the largest number of 19th century free [blacks&#93;""], ''American Visions'', Jun-Jul 1994, accessed 27 December 2008</ref>   Because of this significant past and prehistoric archaeological evidence, the Pocahontas Island Historic District is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].  Ninety percent of the population were native Virginians, as most of their ancestors had been in the state since the 17th and 18th centuries.

When the Civil War started in 1861, Petersburg's men again responded.  They provided the Confederacy several infantry companies and artillery units, as well as three troops of cavalry.  In April 1861 more than 300 free blacks from Petersburg volunteered to work on the fortifications of [[Norfolk, Virginia]] with their own leader.  Slaveholders ""volunteered"" the work of numerous enslaved men.<ref>[http://www.petersburgexpress.com/Petersburg_Black-CSA.html ""Black Confederate Soldiers of Petersburg""], ''Petersburg Express'', accessed 22 December 2008</ref>
The Confederate troops numbered around 2,000.  Union generals Smith and [[Winfield S. Hancock]] were reluctant to attack a fortified line. Confederate General [[P.G.T. Beauregard]] alerted Lee that he was facing the Army of the Potomac at Petersburg. Lee later arrived, and the 292-day [[Siege of Petersburg]] began.
During the 1880s, a coalition of black Republicans and white [[Populist Party (United States)|Populist]]s held power for several years in the state legislature.  This resulted in two major public institutions in Petersburg, as the legislature invested for education and welfare. In 1882, the legislature founded [[Virginia State University]] in nearby Ettrick as Virginia Normal and Collegiate Institute.  It was one of the first public (fully state-supported) four-year [[historically black colleges and universities]] (HBCU) in the [[Mid-Atlantic States|Mid-Atlantic]].  This was part of a drive to improve public education that started with the Reconstruction legislature.<ref>[http://www.boston.com/travel/articles/2005/03/09/civil_war_history_lesson/?page=2 ""Civil War history lesson: Petersburg, Va., embraces and expands its past""], Boston.com, 9 March 2005, accessed 22 December 2008</ref>  [[John Mercer Langston]], a national political leader and former dean of [[Howard University]]'s law department, was selected as the college's first president.<ref>William Cheek and Aimee Lee Cheek, ""John Mercer Langston: Principle and Politics"", in Leon F.

In 1888, Langston was elected to the [[US Congress]] on the Republican ticket, the first [[African American]] to be elected to Congress from Virginia.  He was also the last for nearly a century.<ref>William Cheek and Aimee Lee Cheek, ""John Mercer Langston: Principle and Politics"", in Leon F. Litwack and August Meier, eds., ''Black Leaders of the Nineteenth Century'', University of Illinois, 1991</ref>
In the late 19th and early 20th century, Virginia's conservative white [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]-dominated legislature instituted [[Jim Crow]] laws.  It also approved constitutional changes that established legal racial [[Racial segregation|segregation]] and effectively [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era (United States)|disfranchised]] most blacks and many poor whites.  Those disfranchised suffered major losses in the ability to exercise their rights as citizens. For instance, without being able to vote, they could not serve on juries or be appointed to certain offices. The white legislature consistently underfunded services and schools for blacks. 
Regional tensions were heightened by the city's two large annexations of adjacent portions of Dinwiddie and Prince George Counties in the early 1970s. Despite the large addition of suburban school-age children, a downward trend in public school enrollment continued.  Projected  industrial development of large tracts of vacant in the annexed areas did not materialize. In 1985 city leaders were unable to keep [[Brown & Williamson]] tobacco company, a top employer, from relocating to [[Macon, Georgia]].  The company chose a job market with lower wages and a weaker labor union environment.
In the early 21st century, Petersburg leaders were stressing its historical attractions and industrial sites, with associated access to an exceptionally wide transportation network. The Army has substantially expanded activities at nearby [[Fort Lee]], home of the [[United States Army]]'s [[Sustainment Center of Excellence]], as well as the Army's Logistics Branch, Ordnance, Quartermaster, and Transportation Corps.

Free blacks numbered 3,224 or one-third, attracted to the city for the job opportunities in industries and trades.<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/history/crdi/publications/HM14.pdf ""National Register Nominations: Pocahontas Island Historic District""], ''Heritage Matters'', Jan-Feb 2008, National Park Service, accessed 30 December 2008</ref>  The Petersburg population had the highest percentage of free blacks of any city in the Confederacy and the largest number of free blacks in the Mid-Atlantic.<ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1546/is_n3_v9/ai_15495032/pg_1?tag=artBody;col1 Henry Chase, ""Proud, free and black: Petersburg - visiting the Virginia location of the largest number of 19th century free [blacks&#93;""], ''American Visions'', Jun-Jul 1994, accessed 27 December 2008</ref>  Many free blacks had settled on [[Pocahontas Island, Virginia|Pocahontas Island]].<ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1546/is_n3_v9/ai_15495032/pg_1?tag=artBody;col1 Henry Chase, ""Proud, free and black: Petersburg - visiting the Virginia location of the largest number of 19th century free [blacks&#93;""], ''American Visions'', Jun-Jul 1994, accessed 27 December 2008</ref>   Because of this significant past and prehistoric archaeological evidence, the Pocahontas Island Historic District is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].  Ninety percent of the population were native Virginians, as most of their ancestors had been in the state since the 17th and 18th centuries.

When the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] started in 1861, Petersburg's men again responded.  They provided the Confederacy several infantry companies and artillery units, as well as three troops of cavalry.  In April 1861 more than 300 free blacks from Petersburg volunteered to work on the fortifications of [[Norfolk]] with their own leader.  Slaveholders ""volunteered"" the work of numerous enslaved men.<ref>[http://www.petersburgexpress.com/Petersburg_Black-CSA.html ""Black Confederate Soldiers of Petersburg""], ''Petersburg Express'', accessed 22 December 2008</ref>
The Confederate troops numbered around 2,000.  [[Union]] generals Smith and [[Winfield S. Hancock]] were reluctant to attack a fortified line. Confederate General [[P.G.T. Beauregard]] alerted Lee that he was facing the Army of the Potomac at Petersburg. Lee later arrived, and the 292-day [[Siege of Petersburg]] began.
During the 1880s, a coalition of black Republicans and white [[Populist]]s held power for several years in the state legislature.  This resulted in two major public institutions in Petersburg, as the legislature invested for education and welfare. In 1882, the legislature founded [[Virginia State University]] in nearby Ettrick as Virginia Normal and Collegiate Institute.  It was one of the first public (fully state-supported) four-year [[historically black colleges and universities]] (HBCU) in the [[Mid-Atlantic States|Mid-Atlantic]].  This was part of a drive to improve public education that started with the Reconstruction legislature.<ref>[http://www.boston.com/travel/articles/2005/03/09/civil_war_history_lesson/?page=2 ""Civil War history lesson: Petersburg, Va., embraces and expands its past""], Boston.com, 9 March 2005, accessed 22 December 2008</ref>  [[John Mercer Langston]], a national political leader and former dean of [[Howard University]]'s law department, was selected as the college's first president.<ref>William Cheek and Aimee Lee Cheek, ""John Mercer Langston: Principle and Politics"", in Leon F. Litwack and August Meier, eds., ''Black Leaders of the Nineteenth Century'', University of Illinois, 1991</ref>  An [[Oberlin College]] graduate, he was an accomplished [[lawyer|attorney]] who had been a leader of [[abolitionist]]s in [[Ohio]] and held national appointments.  In 1888, Langston was elected to the [[US Congress]] on the Republican ticket, the first [[African American]] to be elected to Congress from Virginia.  He was also the last for nearly a century.<ref>William Cheek and Aimee Lee Cheek, ""John Mercer Langston: Principle and Politics"", in Leon F. Litwack and August Meier, eds., ''Black Leaders of the Nineteenth Century'', University of Illinois, 1991</ref>
In the late 19th and early 20th century, Virginia's conservative white [[Democratic Party]]-dominated legislature instituted [[Jim Crow]] laws.  It also approved constitutional changes that established legal racial [[Racial segregation|segregation]] and effectively [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era (United States)|disfranchised]] most blacks and many poor whites.  Those disfranchised suffered major losses in the ability to exercise their rights as citizens. For instance, without being able to vote, they could not serve on juries or be appointed to certain offices. The white legislature consistently underfunded services and schools for blacks. 
Regional tensions were heightened by the city's two large annexations of adjacent portions of Dinwiddie and Prince George Counties in the early 1970s. Despite the large addition of suburban school-age children, a downward trend in public school enrollment continued.  Projected  industrial development of large tracts of vacant in the annexed areas did not materialize. In 1985 city leaders were unable to keep [[Brown & Williamson|Brown & Williamson tobacco company]], a top employer, from relocating to [[Macon, Georgia]].  The company chose a job market with lower wages and a weaker labor union environment.
In the early [[21st century]], Petersburg leaders were stressing its historical attractions and industrial sites, with associated access to an exceptionally wide transportation network. The Army has substantially expanded activities at nearby [[Fort Lee]], home of the [[United States Army]]'s [[Sustainment Center of Excellence]], as well as the Army's Logistics Branch, Ordnance, Quartermaster, and Transportation Corps.

He is also for legalizing [[concealed carry]], which would allow a law-abiding, licensed Illinois resident to carry a handgun or other weapon in public in a concealed manner.<ref name=""trib-2010q-social""/><ref>Ill. gubernatorial candidates on guns Dec. 12, 2009 http://www.wandtv.com/Global/story.asp?S=11666917</ref>

===Ethics===
Brady's campaign website states that his administration would be a ""clean break"" from the ethics scandals of past governors.  He supports capping individual campaign contributions at $4,800 for each election cycle and prohibiting union and corporate contributions.<ref name=""campgn-site-ethics"">Brady for Illinois Jul. 24, 2010 http://www.bradyforillinois.com/issues/clean-break-ethics/</ref>

Brady has opposed requiring campaign contributors to list their occupations. He also dismissed adopting detailed federal-style statements of economic interest for public officials in Illinois as an ""overreaction.""<ref name=""brady-undr-scrut"">Republican governor nominee Bill Brady under greater scrutiny Mar. 6, 2010 http://newsblogs.chicagotribune.com/clout_st/2010/03/republican-governor-nominee-bill-brady-under-greater-scrutiny.html</ref>

===Term limits===
Brady has called for term limits in Illinois. He would limit legislators to five terms in the House and three terms in the Senate.<ref>Local Elections - Bill Brady, Candidate for Governor of Illinois http://abclocal.go.com/wls/feature?section=news/politics/local_elections&id=7206465</ref>

===Taxes===
Brady has opposed efforts to raise state sales and income tax rates in Illinois. He favors reducing [[sales tax]]es that he claims drive retail jobs and businesses to other states. He favors dedicating a percentage of Illinois revenue to property tax relief{{Clarify|date=August 2010}} and eliminating the [[estate tax]] in Illinois.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

=== Animal welfare ===
Brady sponsored a bill that would allow the mass [[euthanasia]] of [[dogs]] and [[cats]].  After it received considerable criticism, he retracted his sponsorship and now has said that he would veto any such bill.<ref>Illinois General Assembly website, accessed Oct 20 2010, http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/billstatus.asp?DocNum=2999&GAID=10&GA=96&DocTypeID=SB&LegID=50273&SessionID=76</ref><ref>Chicago Sun-Times, Brady Backs Further Away From Euthanizing Animals, Oct  19 2010, http://www.suntimes.com/news/elections/2814866,CST-NWS-campaign19.article</ref>

Wearing the number 1, in his first collegiate game against [[Sacramento State#Athletics|Sacramento State]] in [[2005 California Golden Bears football team|2005]], Jackson scored both an offensive and special teams touchdown, returning a punt 49&nbsp;yards for a score.

In the [[2005 Las Vegas Bowl]] game against [[BYU Cougars football|BYU]], Jackson tallied 130&nbsp;yards and two scores.

Coming into his sophomore year with high expectations, Jackson displayed more of his talent and playmaking ability, tallying 1,060 receiving&nbsp;yards and nine touchdowns. Jackson also returned four punts for touchdowns. He earned first-team All-[[Pac-10]] honors as both a punt returner and a wide receiver.  Jackson garnered national recognition with selections to first-team [[2006 College Football All-America Team|All-America]] by the ''[[Associated Press]]'', [[Walter Camp Football Foundation]], the [[Football Writers Association of America]], the ''[[Sporting News]]'' and ''[[Rivals.com]]'' as a punt returner.

People often get this and the V sign confused as the V sign stands for encouraging Victory when the palm is facing the person you are communicating with, as used by Winston Churchill during the World Wars.

The inverse V (i.e. with the palm hidden) is showing your lack of support in an offensive way i.e. ""fuck off"", however,  it is a statement of wishing others to lose.

Between 1914 and 1918 he participated in war work as a commissioned officer in the Austrian fortress artillery ([[Gorizia]], [[Duino]], [[Sistiana]], Prosecco, Vienna). On 6 April 1920, Schrödinger married Annemarie Bertel. The same year, he became the assistant to [[Max Wien]], in [[Jena]], and in September 1920 he attained the position of ao. Prof. (''Ausserordentlicher Professor''), roughly equivalent to Reader (UK) or associate professor (US), in [[Stuttgart]]. In 1921, he became o. Prof. (''Ordentlicher Professor'', i.e. full professor), in [[Breslau University|Breslau]] (now [[Wrocław]], Poland).

In 1921, he moved to the [[University of Zurich|University of Zürich]]. In January 1926, Schrödinger published in ''[[Annalen der Physik]]'' the paper ""''Quantisierung als Eigenwertproblem''"" [''tr''. Quantization as an [[Eigenvalue]] Problem] on wave mechanics and what is now known as the [[Schrödinger equation]]. In this paper he gave a ""derivation"" of the wave equation for time independent systems, and showed that it gave the correct energy eigenvalues for the [[hydrogen-like atom]]. This paper has been universally celebrated as one of the most important achievements of the twentieth century, and created a revolution in quantum mechanics, and indeed of all physics and chemistry. A second paper was submitted just four weeks later that solved the [[quantum harmonic oscillator]], the [[rigid rotor]] and the [[diatomic molecule]], and gives a new derivation of the Schrödinger equation. A third paper in May showed the equivalence of his approach to that of Heisenberg and gave the treatment of the [[Stark effect]]. A fourth paper in this most remarkable series showed how to treat problems in which the system changes with time, as in [[scattering]] problems. These papers were the central achievement of his career and were at once recognized as having great significance by the physics community.

In 1927, he succeeded [[Max Planck]] at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Friedrich Wilhelm University]] in Berlin. In 1933, however, Schrödinger decided to leave Germany; he disliked the Nazis' [[anti-semitism]]. He became a Fellow of [[Magdalen College, Oxford|Magdalen College]] at the [[University of Oxford]]. Soon after he arrived, he received the [[Nobel Prize]] together with [[Paul Dirac|Paul Adrien Maurice Dirac]]. His position at Oxford did not work out; his unconventional personal life (Schrödinger lived with two women)<ref>Walter J. Moore. Schrödinger, life and thought, 278 ff.</ref> was not met with acceptance. In 1934, Schrödinger lectured at [[Princeton University]]; he was offered a permanent position there, but did not accept it. Again, his wish to set up house with his wife and his mistress may have posed a problem. {{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} He had the prospect of a position at the [[University of Edinburgh]] but visa delays occurred, and in the end he took up a position at the [[University of Graz]] in Austria in 1936.

In the midst of these tenure issues in 1935, after extensive correspondence with personal friend [[Albert Einstein]], he proposed the [[Schrödinger's cat]] [[thought experiment]].",,DONKEY BALLS,False,1,1

The '''Iron Bowl''' is a common name for the [[college football]] game between the [[Auburn University]] [[Auburn Tigers football|Tigers]] and the [[University of Alabama]] [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|Crimson Tide]]. The series is considered one of the best and most hard-fought rivalries in all of sports.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://espn.go.com/endofcentury/s/other/bestrivalries.html| title=The 10 greatest rivalries| publisher=ESPN| date=2007-01-03| accessdate=2008-10-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| url=http://books.google.com/books?id=jpehWR53e7AC| title=Football Feuds: The Greatest College Football Rivalries| last=Rappoport| first=Ken| coauthors=Barry Wilner| publisher=Globe Pequot| year=2007| isbn=1599210142| chapter=The Iron Bowl: Auburn-Alabama| page=77 |ref=FootballFeuds}}</ref> As the rivalry was mainly played in [[Birmingham, Alabama]] for many years, the name of the Iron Bowl comes from Birmingham's historic role in the iron and steel industry.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://collegefootball.about.com/od/rivalries/a/riv-ironbowl.htm| title=Alabama-Auburn Rivalry – The Iron Bowl| publisher=About.com| last=Hyland| first=Tim| accessdate=2008-10-12}}</ref> Alabama leads the series with an overall record of 40–33–1. 

The games are played at [[Jordan–Hare Stadium]] in [[Auburn, Alabama|Auburn]] every odd-numbered year, and in [[Bryant–Denny Stadium]] at [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama|Tuscaloosa]] every even-numbered year. For much of the 20th century the game was played every year at [[Legion Field]] in Birmingham. Alabama has a 32–15 record in games played at Legion Field, while Auburn has a 7–3 record in games played at Jordan–Hare Stadium and a 6–1 record in games played at Bryant–Denny Stadium. In 2007, the game was pushed back to [[Thanksgiving]] weekend.

Due to a television contract between the [[Southeastern Conference|SEC]] and [[CBS Sports]], the 2009 and 2010 Iron Bowls are both scheduled to be played on the Friday after Thanksgiving. The 2009 game was the sixth Iron Bowl to be played on a Friday and the first in 21 years.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://msn.foxsports.com/cbk/story/9455280/Iron-Bowl-moves-to-Friday-Rivalry-game-falls-on-day-after-Thanksgiving-| title=Iron Bowl moves to Friday Rivalry game falls on day after Thanksgiving | publisher=Fox Sports| accessdate=2009-04-17}}</ref>

==History==
Auburn and Alabama (also known as Pussy U) played their first football game in Lakeview Park in [[Birmingham, Alabama]], on February 22, 1893. Auburn (then named the [[Auburn University|Agricultural and Mechanical College of Alabama]]) won 32–22, before an estimated crowd of 5,000. As if a signal of the future, disagreement between the schools began immediately as Alabama considered the game to be the final matchup of the 1892 season and Auburn recorded it as the first of 1893. 

Tensions further built when, after both 1906 and 1907 contests, Auburn head coach [[Mike Donahue]] threatened to cancel the series if Alabama head coach [[J. W. H. Pollard|""Doc"" Pollard]] continued employing his elaborate formations and shifts.<ref>Groom, 2000, p. 16.</ref> The series was indeed suspended after the 1907 game when the schools could not come to agreement over the amount of expenses to be paid players, as well as from where officials for the game should be obtained.<ref>[[#FootballFeuds|Football Feuds]]: 79</ref>

In 1947 the Alabama House of Representatives passed a resolution encouraging the schools to ""make possible the inauguration of a full athletic program between the two schools"".<ref>{{cite web | year=2006 | url=http://www.coloradotigers.com/concourse/traditions_ironbowl.htm | title=The Auburn-Alabama Rivalry, ""The Iron Bowl"" | publisher=Rocky Mountain Auburn Club | accessdate=2006-12-04}}</ref> Ralph B. Draughon, the president of Auburn (then named the [[Auburn University|Alabama Polytechnic Institute]]), and Alabama president John Gallalee decided during the winter and spring of 1948 to end the disagreement and renew the series. The games would be played in [[Birmingham]] because it had the largest stadium in the state, 44,000-seat [[Legion Field]], and the tickets would be split evenly between the two schools. Alabama won the first game when the series renewed 55–0, the most lopsided victory of the series.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.1122productions.com/brandon/ftbstats/2000/week10-2000.html| title=The University of Alabama Football Facts| year=2000| accessdate=2008-10-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.rolltide.com/archive_files/files/football/2007/mediaguide/176-181.pdf| title=This is Alabama Football: Iron Bowl| publisher=University of Alabama Athletics| pages=157| accessdate=2008-10-08}}</ref> 

By 1980 the series had come to be called the Iron Bowl, due to [[Birmingham]]'s prominence as a center of [[iron]] and [[steel]] production. Throughout the 1980s, Auburn made additions to [[Jordan-Hare Stadium]], and in 1987 it eclipsed [[Legion Field]] in size. Auburn desired to make the Iron Bowl a ""home-and-home"" series, and the schools reached an agreement where Auburn could play their home games for the Iron Bowl in Auburn starting in 1989 (except for the 1991 game, which was played at [[Legion Field]]), and Alabama would have a ""home"" ticket allocation for games in [[Legion Field]]. On December 2, 1989, Alabama came to Auburn's [[Jordan-Hare Stadium]] for the first time in the history of the rivalry. A sellout crowd would witness Auburn win its first true ""home"" game of the series, 30–20 over an Alabama team that entered the game unbeaten and ranked #2 in the country.

Alabama continued to hold their home game at Legion Field. In 1998, Alabama expanded [[Bryant-Denny Stadium]] to a capacity of 83,818, exceeding Legion Field by a few hundred. Alabama moved their home games in the series to Bryant-Denny Stadium in 2000. A new attendance record for the Iron Bowl was set in 2006 as the latest expansion to Bryant-Denny Stadium increased its capacity to 92,138. A new Iron Bowl attendance will be set in 2010, again in Alabama's Bryant Denny, when a crowd of 101,821 will witness the Iron Bowl in person.

==Foy-ODK Sportsmanship Award==
The [[trophy]] given to the winner of the game is the [[Foy-ODK Sportsmanship Award]]. It is named after James E. Foy, an Alabama graduate and former Auburn dean of students and [[Omicron Delta Kappa]] Honor Society – which was established on both campuses during the 1920s. The Foy Trophy is presented at halftime of the Auburn–Alabama basketball game later in the same academic year at the winner's coliseum. After the trophy presentation, the SGA President of the losing school must recite his or her adversary's fight song.

==Notable games==
<!-- ""Titles"" of games should only be included if they are commonly understood as a reference to a particular game (ie ""Run in the Mud,"" ""Punt Bama Punt,"" and ""The Kick"").  Please do not make up your own titles. -->

'''1964 -''' The Iron Bowl was first broadcast nationally on November 26, 1964. [[Joe Namath]] led Alabama to a 21–14 victory over Auburn, and Alabama would go on to win its eighth national championship.

'''1967 – The Run in The Mud -''' On a night at Legion Field where thunderstorms were so bad that the field had to be constantly cleared of raincoats and other wet weather accessories that blew in from the stands, Alabama quarterback [[Kenny Stabler]] ran for a 47&nbsp;yard touchdown to give Bama a 7–3 win.<ref>Groom, 2000, p. 128.</ref>

'''1971 -''' Both teams were playing for a shot at the national championship against [[Nebraska Cornhuskers football|Nebraska]] in the Orange Bowl. 10–0 Alabama (#4 AP) earned a 31–7 victory over [[Heisman trophy]] winner [[Pat Sullivan (American football)|Pat Sullivan]] and 9–0 Auburn (AP #5).

'''1972 – [[Punt Bama Punt]] -''' Trailing 16–3 with six minutes left, underdog Auburn blocked two Alabama punts – returning both for touchdowns – to win the game 17–16, handing Alabama its first loss of the season and ending its national title hopes.

'''1981 – 315 -''' Alabama Coach [[Paul ""Bear"" Bryant]] got his 315th career victory, passing [[Amos Alonzo Stagg]] to become the then-all-time winningest Division I-A coach in a 28–17 win over Auburn.

'''1982 – Bo Over the Top -''' Auburn drove the field and scored with two minutes left when [[Bo Jackson]] jumped over the top of the pile on the one yard line. Auburn won the game 23–22. It ended Alabama's 9 game winning streak, the longest in the rivalry's history. It would be Coach Bear Bryant's last Iron Bowl.  

'''1984 – Wrong Way Bo -''' Late in the fourth quarter on 4th and goal from the one-yard line and Auburn trailing by two points, Coach [[Pat Dye]] decided to go for the touchdown instead of a field goal. The ball went to [[Brent Fullwood]] and the legendary [[Bo Jackson]] was supposed to block, but he headed in the wrong direction, leaving Tide defensive back Rory Turner free to take Fullwood out of bounds, preventing the score. Alabama would hold on to win 17–15 and knocked Auburn out of the Sugar Bowl.

'''1985 – The Kick -''' At their own 12-yard line and trailing 23–22 with only 37 seconds remaining, Alabama quarterback [[Mike Shula]] and the Tide offense drove to the Auburn 35-yard line to set up a 52-yard [[field goal (football)|field goal]] by [[Van Tiffin]], winning the game 25–23 as time expired.

'''1989 -''' In the first Iron Bowl ever played in Auburn, the #11 Tigers beat #2 and previously unbeaten Alabama 30–20.

'''1993 -''' 10–0 Auburn (#6 AP) came from behind to defeat 8–1–1 Alabama (#11 AP) in the second Iron Bowl ever played in Auburn, 22–14, capping Auburn's undefeated season. This game is also notable because it was not televised (due to Auburn's probation), but was shown on closed-circuit TV in Tuscaloosa, becoming the first college football game ever to sell out two stadiums at the same time.

'''1994 -''' 10–0 Alabama (#3 AP) defeated 9–0–1 Auburn (#6 AP) 21–14 in a matchup of undefeated teams, snapping Auburn's 21-game unbeaten streak.

'''1997 -''' After Auburn recovered an Ed Scissum fumble on a screen pass that would have resulted in a first down and sealed an Alabama victory, Jaret Holmes nailed a 39 yard field goal with 21 seconds left to lift Auburn over Alabama 18–17 and send Auburn to its first SEC Championship Game appearance.

'''1999 -''' Alabama gets their first win ever at Auburn, 28–17.

'''2000 -''' The Iron Bowl returned to Tuscaloosa for the first time in 99 years.  In the first Iron Bowl ever played in Bryant-Denny Stadium amidst miserable weather conditions of cold and sleet, Auburn clinched the SEC West title with a 9–0 shutout in [[Mike DuBose]]'s final game as Alabama head coach. 

'''2003 -''' Auburn's Carnell ""Cadillac"" Williams runs for over 200 yards and an 80-yard run on the first play from scrimmage. Auburn won 28–23.

'''2005 -''' #11 Auburn sacked Alabama's quarterback Brodie Croyle eleven times en route to a 28–18 victory over the #9 Crimson Tide.

'''2008 -''' Alabama ends Auburn's streak of six consecutive victories with a 36–0 win in what would be Tommy Tuberville's last season as Auburn's head coach.  It was also Alabama's first Iron Bowl victory in Tuscaloosa, ending a six-game losing streak in the Iron Bowl and a four-game losing streak in [[Bryant-Denny Stadium]].

'''2009 -''' Undefeated #2 Alabama got down 14–0 early in Auburn against the 7–4 Tigers. A reverse and a surprise onside kick contributed to the Tiger's quick start. Alabama came back and tied the game. The score was 14–14 at the half. Auburn regained the lead 21–14 in the 3rd quarter, but Alabama battled back. Trailing 21–20, the Tide went on a 15 play, 79 yard drive that lasted 7 minutes and 3 seconds to take a 26–21 lead with 1:24 left. Auburn drove inside the Alabama 40, but the  Tiger's Hail Mary on the last play failed, sealing Alabama's second consecutive undefeated regular season en route to the school's 13th national championship.

'''2010-''' #2 Auburn will enter the 2010 Iron bowl undefeated and face a 9-2 #11 ranked Alabama team

The Ottawa Valley has a bounty of food. There are many locally grown products such as fruit, vegetables, eggs, meat, wild crafted teas, herbal vinegars, jellies, pickles, honey and maple syrup.

There are many farms where people can go and pick their own produce. The prices are lower because the farm does not have to do the labour themselves and the buyers know what they are buying is fresh.

The Gävle Goat was burnt on December 3 and the weekend escalated into a frenzy of copycat goat-burning. The [[Visby]] goat on [[Gotland]] burned down, the Yule Goat in [[Söderköping]], [[Östergötland]] was torched, and there was an attack on a goat located in [[Lycksele]], [[Västerbotten]].

During its first year of operation (after its launch in 2009), Redbana Corporation's Community Manager position has changed three times. Generally, most are fans of the first Community Manager the company had, who was known by the [[pseudonym]] ''Gleem''. However, after Gleem was replaced by a second Community Manager (known as ''Break!''), communication between the company and the community slowly diminished. Very little was told to the players about the hacking situation and various crashes, causing many of the players to believe that the community as a whole was being ignored. Users who added Break! as a friend on [[Facebook]] report that when servers crashed at the company, Break! was found to be playing various Facebook games. After Break! was replaced by a third Community Manager (known as ''Mundo''), communication between the company and the players reformed.

Hemp Jewelry uses hemp twine that is made from the plant Cannabis sativa which directly translates to “common hemp”. This strand of Cannabis is cultivated to make vast amounts of goods including foods, fuels, clothing and textiles, cosmetics, paints, paper, building materials and plastics. Industrial hemp is a dependable raw material: it matures in one growing season and is easily cultivated in many climates. It also grows without herbicides or insecticides and can replace many products manufactured from cotton, timber or petrochemicals. It is ideal for macramé jewelry because it is durable, mildew resistant and stronger than cotton fiber. Hemp Jewelry consists of bracelets, necklaces, anklets, ring, watches, masks, purses, and other adornments. The jewelry can also go more abstract, instead of blandly just using the hemp, by adding glass, wood, bones, rocks, gems, and other knick knacks.

History
 Barometer - Pronunciation: [b u rom´ u t u r] - a barometer is an instrument for measuring atmospheric pressure. Two common types are the aneroid barometer and the mercurial barometer (invented first). Evangelista Torricelli invented the first barometer, known as the ""Torricelli's tube"".

Biography - Evangelista Torricelli
Evangelista Torricelli was born October 15, 1608, in Faenza, Italy and died October 22, 1647 in Florence, Italy. He was a physicist and mathematician. In 1641, Evangelista Torricelli moved to Florence to assist the astronomer Galileo.

The Barometer
It was Galileo that suggested Evangelista Torricelli use mercury in his vacuum experiments. Torricelli filled a four-foot long glass tube with mercury and inverted the tube into a dish. Some of the mercury did not escape from the tube and Torricelli observed the vacuum that was created.
Evangelista Torricelli became the first scientist to create a sustained vacuum and to discover the principle of a barometer. Torricelli realized that the variation of the height of the mercury from day to day was caused by changes in the atmospheric pressure. Torricelli built the first mercury barometer around 1644. 

Evangelista Torricelli - Other Research
Evangelista Torricelli also wrote on the quadrature of the cycloid and conics, the rectifications of the logarithmic spiral, the theory of the barometer, the value of gravity found by observing the motion of two weights connected by a string passing over a fixed pulley, the theory of projectiles and the motion of fluids. 
Lucien Vidie - Aneroid Barometer
In 1843, the French scientist Lucien Vidie invented the aneroid barometer. A aneroid barometer ""registers the change in the shape of an evacuated metal cell to measure variations on the atmospheric pressure."" Aneriod means fluidless, no liquids are used, the metal cell is usually made of phosphor bronze or beryllium copper.

Related Instruments
An altimeter is an aneroid barometer that measures altitude. Meteorologists use an altimeter that measures the altitude with respect to sea level pressure.
A barograph is an aneroid barometer that gives a continuous reading of atmospheric pressures on graph paper.

Ramayana, the Hindu epic, carries a discussion between Rama and a Sage on Nihilism. An article on the website containing translation of the said epic states ""The literary style of Ramayana is mostly un-Paninian. It has the episodes like Rama-Jaabaali samvaada, where Sage Jaabaali being a nihilist starts preaching nihilism to Rama.""

The sage Jaabaali tries to stop Rama from going to the forest to fulfill the latter's promise to his father by saying ""'''Who is related to whom? What is there to be obtained by anything and by whom? Every creature is born alone and dies alone.''' O, Rama! He who clings to another, saying, 'This is my father, this is my mother, he should be known as one who has lost his wits. There is none who belongs to another. O, Rama! '''As one who passes the a strange village spends the night the and the next day leaves that place and continues his journey, so are mother, father, home and possessions to a man; they are but a resting place. The wise do not become attached to them.''' ... I pity all those whosoever, devoted to wealth and religious merit, not other (who are devoted to sense-enjoyment), for, they, having undergone suffering in this life, have met with extermination after death.These people say, 'The eighth day should be given up to sacrifices for the spirits of our ancestors.' See the waste of food. What will a dead man eat?If food eaten by one here, reaches another's body, then let a sacrifice be offered for those who are setting out on a distant journey. Will it not become a food on their path? Perform sacrifices, distribute gifts, consecrate yourselves, practise ansterity and renunciation' ... O, the highly wise! Arrive at a conclusion, therefore, that there is nothing beyond this Universe. '''Give precedence to that which meets the eye and turn your back on what is beyond our knowledge.'''""

Steel Train have the privilege of being one of the only bands who met in elementary school (Jack Antonoff, Evan Winiker and Daniel Silbert met in the early 90's at The Solomon Schechter Day School of Bergen County). The three played in various bands around New Jersey in the late 90's and early millenium (Outline and Random Task) and were part of a music scene that gave birth to such bands as [[My Chemical Romance]], [[The Gaslight Anthem]] and [[Saves The Day]] (in many interviews they've credited this scene as an influence on their live shows).
In 2002 the owners of [[Drive-Thru Records]] got a copy of the bands demo and signed them to a 5 record deal with Drive Thru Records/MCA, it would be the beginning of a fruitful/tumultous relationship.
The band flew to Los Angeles in October of 2002 to record with Jon Naclario and Slamm Andrews at Hans Zimmer's Media Ventures Studio's, the outcome of this session would be the band's first EP, 2003's ""For You My Dear"" (The EP would go on to sell over 30,000 in its first year).
To promote the EP the band hit the road, touring America with [[Something Corporate]], [[Finch]], and [[The RX Bandits]] and going overseas to the UK and Whales with Something Corporate and [[Home Grown]].
In late 2003 the band would move to San Francisco to record their first full length record with Steven Barncard (The Grateful Dead, CSNY, Joe Cocker). Released in 2005, ""Twilight Tales From The Prairies on the Sun"" featured appearances by famed mandolinist/Jerry Garcia collaborater [[David Grisman]], as well as Flying Burrito Brother/Byrds pedal steel guitarist [[Gene Parsons]].
2005 would also see the beginning of the bands heavy touring cycle, playing over 200 shows in 300 days. It would also be the beginning of the bands festival career, playing a milestone set at midnight on the first day of The Bonnaroo Music Festival in Manchester, Tennesee. The band would go on to play The Wakarusa Festival, The All Good Festival, High Sierra Music Festival as well as another appearance at 2006's Bonnaroo Music Festival.

After a grueling two years straight on the road, original members Matt Goldman, Matthias Gruber and Scott Irby Ranniar would leave the band to persue other careers (Goldman became a teacher, Gruber moved back to Germany and Irby Ranniar would get into graphic design).

At this point, Jack and Evan moved to Silverlake, CA to record the bands second full length, ''[[Trampoline (album)|Trampoline]]'' with [[Mark Trombino]] (Jimmy Eat World, Rilo Kiley). After an easy recording process, the band once again embarked on the road, this time recruiting three new members Jon Shiffman, Justin Huey, and Daniel Silbert (who up to that point had been the tour manager).

The band headed out in support of ""Trampoline""  which debuted  at #10 on Billboard's Heatseaker Chart. The band toured with [[The Format]], [[Silversun Pickups]], [[Gomez]], [[The Spill Canvas]], the [[Barenaked Ladies]], [[Hanson]] and played prominent spots at the Lollapalooza Festival as well as making their third appearance at the Bonnaroo Music Festival.

In the summer of 2008 the band would make their national television debut on Late Night With Conan O'Brien.

Jack and Evan would once again head back into the studio, this time to record their third full length with producer Steve Mcdonald (Be Your Own Pet, Fun). It would be at this time that the band's relationship with their label Drive Thru Records would fall apart. The label (who's roster at one point included Hellogoodbye, New found Glory, Dashboard Confessional as well as many other platinum selling artists), had cut ties with its previous distributors MCA, Geffen, Sanctuary, and was going through changes. Not wanting to hold the release of their album, Steel Train decided to buy off the label and fund the record themselves. Taking a page from bands like [[Radiohead]], they bet on themselves and decided to self release the album in 2010.<ref>[http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=1263062 ""Steel Train No Longer With DTR.""]  Absolutepunk.net.  August 14, 2009.</ref>

Once again they hit the road hard, touring with [[Tegan and Sara]], [[Ben Folds]], [[Fun.]] as well as playing 2010's Coachella Music Festival and making their 2nd appearance on National TV on The Late Show With David Letterman.

The band would release their 3rd full length ""Steel Train"" on June 28th to critical acclaim from Spin, Esquire, USA Today and many other national publications. The record would debut at #8 on Billboard's Heatseakers Chart, #48 on its independent albums chart as well as a handful of other Billboard Charts (it would stay there for weeks).

Thinking ahead, Steel Train released a companion album of their songs covered by female artists, having their songs covered by [[Scarlett Johansson]], Tegan and Sara, Amanda Palmer of the Dresden Doll's, Deradorian of [[The Dirty Projectors]], Anna Waronker of That Dog, Charlotte Caffey of The Go Go's, Holly Miranda, Rachel Antonoff, as well as many others.

The band would hit the road once again at appearances with [[Yo Gabba Gabba]], the hit childrens show, as well as tours with OAR and Fun.

On November 1st the band the pleasure of being Conan O'Brien's first musical guests on his new show, in a joke episode titled ""Show Zero"". The band, along with actor [[Jim Parsons]] (The Big Bang Theory) would perform one chord off their new record in a short version of the show.",,"==History==
The band began when two friends, Jack Antonoff and [[Scott Irby-Ranniar]], began playing music together in high school in New York City. In 2002, the band signed to Drive-Thru Records and recorded their debut EP, ''For You My Dear'', recruiting Evan Winiker (formerly of New Jersey pop punk band Random Task) and Matthias Gruber to help with recording and touring. The two later became full members of the band, first Winiker, and later Gruber, who joined with second guitarist Matthew Goldman to complete the band. The band went on to record the ''1969'' EP (a CD of cover versions of songs from that year that inspired the band and their sound), and a year later their debut album ''Twilight Tales from the Prairies of the Sun'', released in 2005.
Also in 2005, the band covered Dylan's ""[[Don't Think Twice, It's Alright]]"" and ""[[I Shall Be Released]]"" for the [[Listen to Bob Dylan: A Tribute]] CD.
In December 2006 the band announced that they would be parting ways with Matthias Gruber (drums) and Matt Goldman (guitar) who chose to pursue other interests.  The positions were quickly filled by long-time tour manager Daniel Silbert on guitar and hometown friend Jon Shiffman on drums.
In 2007, the new line-up released the LP, ''[[Trampoline (album)|Trampoline]]''.  The album was well received by audiences and critics alike, garnering the band slots at Bonnaroo, Lollapalooza, and Late Night with Conan O'Brien in 2008. Shortly after the release of the record, [[Scott Irby-Ranniar]] decided to leave the band and was replaced by North Carolina native Justin Huey. 
In August 2009, the band left long-time label [[Drive-Thru Records]].<ref>[http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=1263062 ""Steel Train No Longer With DTR.""]  Absolutepunk.net.  August 14, 2009.</ref>

James K. Polk and the U.S. Mexican War: A Policy Appraisal
A Conversation With David M. Pletcher
Indiana University

 James K. Polk Some people believe that President James K. Polk intentionally provoked the war with Mexico. What do you say about that?
What Polk wanted was to push Mexico into negotiating with the United States, and he was willing to create a threat of war to do this. If he had to fight, he wanted a short war and a quick victory. He never expected a long-drawn-out war. The Army was not ready for war and had never fought so far from home before. The country was divided. So Polk was taking a considerable risk in his bold stand toward Mexico.

Negotiations might have been possible if Polk had tried a different approach. Mexico had refused to recognize either the independence of Texas or its annexation by the United States, and when annexation occurred, broke relations and withdrew its minster from Washington. Polk rightly believed that he had to restore diplomatic relations, so he sent a special temporary envoy to Mexico. The Mexicans expected that envoy, John Slidell, would offer an indemnity to settle the Texas question, after which Mexico would receive him or someone else as permanent minister. Instead Polk made Slidell permanent minister and instructed him to open negotiations for the sale of California, ignoring Texas completely.

This did not suit the Mexicans at all. If they started by making a concession on Slidell’s status they would probably never get any settlement on Texas. Also Polk had backed up Slidell by sending troops to the Rio Grande, which Texans claimed was their proper boundary. The Mexican president, José Herrera, was newly in office and not very powerful. He did not dare receive Slidell for fear of being overthrown, as the opposition press was accusing him of planning to betray the country by selling Texas. Since he could not be received, Slidell left Mexico City for a town a few miles away, and Herrera sent troops to the Rio Grande to confront the Americans. Matters had reached an impasse.

Polk now needed an excuse to declare war, expecting at the most to fight a few skirmishes on the Rio Grande and then start negotiating. The Mexicans gave him the excuse he needed. The general commanding their troops on the Rio Grande sent a force across the river, and it ambushed a detachment of Americans and killed or captured all of them. The American general, Zachary Taylor, reported this action as a Mexican attack and concluded: ""I presume this means the beginning of war."" Polk and his cabinet prepared a declaration of war. Congress, badly divided between war and peace, had to support American soldiers under attack and voted to send supplies and reinforcements, whereupon Polk’s Democratic supporters convinced them that they might as well declare war altogether. 

But Polk still did not expect the Mexicans to put up much of a fight. When his brother in Europe learned of what had happened, he wanted to come home and enlist, but Polk told him not to, as the war would soon be over.

How important was the Texan boundary controversy as a cause of the war?
For Polk it was more an excuse than a real cause. When he took office in 1845, the Texans occupied most of what is now east Texas, and San Antonio was only a frontier settlement. The Texans, like most American westerners, wanted to expand, and several years before Polk became president, they had sent a military expedition to take Santa Fe, to the west. The Mexicans beat them, so they had no claim to that part of the Rio Grande valley.

The Mexicans also tried to reconquer the rest of Texas but failed, so an uneasy balance remained. When the United States annexed Texas, Polk promised to protect the Texans from Mexico’s wrath and sent troops under Taylor to Corpus Christi. When Slidell went to Mexico, Taylor moved to the Rio Grande and built a temporary fort. Obviously the Texan boundary dispute was a proper subject for negotiation with Mexico, but Polk made it part of his strong stand.

Polk was negotiating with England at the same time over Oregon, wasn’t he? How did this affect his relations with Mexico?
Years before the U.S. and Britain had agreed to occupy the Oregon territory (modern Oregon, Washington state, and British Columbia) jointly as a temporary settlement. When Polk became president, negotiations had been reopened, and the states of the Middle West were clamoring for the U.S. to annex the whole territory.

Polk wanted to work out a compromise settlement without alienating the Western Senators and Congressmen, whose votes he needed for the rest of his legislative program. His idea was to stall until England took the initiative in offering a settlement. About the time Slidell went to Mexico he succeeded, and England showed a disposition to negotiate some sort of compromise. Up to that point Polk had been reluctant to force matters with Mexico. Fortunately for him, the British government became involved in a cabinet crisis of their own and did not want a quarrel with the U.S. Their more moderate attitude toward Oregon, in a sense, freed Pok to press Mexico harder. (After the war began, the U.S. and England split the Oregon territory along the line of the present U.S.-Canadian border. The Western politicians were dissatisfied but eventually accepted the settlement.)

Why did Polk try to bluff Mexico into negotiating instead of using persuasion?
Polk was very anxious to purchase California from Mexico, and he knew that Mexico would refuse to give it up. He thought there was no time to be lost, as he feared that England would seize it as a strong point on the Pacific. The London government had no such plans, for it had no claims on California as England did on Oregon. England was about to settle the Oregon controversy with the U.S. and was not likely to start another Anglo-American crisis over California.

But Polk’s stubborn, aggressive, self-confident personality was the underlying reason for his policy of taking a strong stand and bluffing his opponents — ""stonewalling,"" as we might call if now. The characteristics he shared with his mentor and patron Andrew Jackson. He had grown up in the lower Mississippi valley during the last stages of the Spanish Empire and had learned to hate and mistrust the deceitful Spanish ""dons,"" with whom he now identified the Mexicans. Their weak, fumbling government only aroused his contempt. Americans at that time generally respected the British for their strength, and so did Polk. But England, he thought, would take anything she could. In both cases, he felt, the wisest course was what we would now call ""eyeball"" diplomacy — staring hard at the opponent and expecting him to blink first. This technique was beginning to work with England, and Polk had no doubt that it would also work with Mexico.

Unfortunately, this was exactly the wrong tactic to employ against Mexico, for it offended the Mexicans sense of honor and made the Mexicans dig in their heels and fight harder, even in a losing cause. A British diplomat who was familiar with the Spanish temperament said, ""A Spaniard is like a mule. If you are riding this mule along a precipice and you spur him too hard, it will back off the cliff with you and take you down the chasm with him.""

A good diplomat has to alternate tenacity and pliability, as the situation requires. He also has to be able to see the negotiation from the viewpoint of his opponent, as well as his own. Polk could do neither of these things; indeed, I think he had an inward contempt for diplomatic solutions.

What were the effects of Polk’s errors in negotiation?
The most immediate and obvious effect was a war lasting a year and nine months. In this war nearly 13,000 American men lost their lives and the country incurred expenses amounting to about $100,000 million. As a result of the U.S.-Mexican War, the settlement of the Oregon boundary and the annexation of Texas, the U.S. gained about 1.2 million square miles of land, over one-third of its present territory. But it incurred a number of indirect effects from the war, and these cannot be ignored. On the positive side, it took a big step up toward becoming a great power, on a par with Britain, France, and Russia, for the older nations respected strength, and American generals and soldiers had displayed this in abundance, even against a weaker foe.

But on the negative side, the war exacted heavy intangible costs as well. Latin Americans have usually looked up to us as a model of a liberal, democratic society and a government. Now, after our attack on Mexico, there began to be talk of ""the colossus of the North."" The United States had always been known for distasteful boasting and loud talk; after the war this became louder, and the feats of the American army suggested that the world might expect more than talk in the future. Worst of all, the Texas question and even more the war itself created an open wound of sectionalism inside the country, and the spread of slavery rose to the top of the list of public problems demanding solution. The war trained a generation of soldiers for the civil strife to come; it also trained the minds of the public at large.

Polk might have avoided these mixed effects of the war with a different line of diplomacy as president.",False,0,1

==Background==
He was born in [[1954]] in [[Dublin]], [[Ireland]], son of [[Patrick Denis O'Donnell]], who served briefly as a United Nations military observer with [[UNTSO]], the oldest UN peace-keeping operation in the world<ref>''An Appreciation'', article on editorial page of The Irish Times, Dublin, 24 January 2005</ref>.

==Education==
He is an honours graduate in [[Economics]] and [[Philosophy]] from the [[National University of Ireland]] at [[University College Dublin]], and has also read [[International Law]] and [[Diplomacy]] at postgraduate level in [[Geneva]], and qualified in Disaster Management at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]]. In the summer of 1997, he was the subject of a two-page feature as a successful graduate in the inaugural summer 1997 issue of ""UCD Connections"" (University College Dublin, his alma-mater), and more recently in the CoRD magazine in [[Belgrade]].

==UN career==
Since 1976, when he started as a United Nations Volunteer in [[Sudan]], he has also served the UN in [[Lesotho]], [[Mauritania]], [[Niger]], [[Switzerland]], [[Turkey]], the [[United States of America]], and recently in [[Serbia & Montenegro]]. He also undertook short missions in over 40 other countries in [[Africa]], [[Asia]], the [[Middle East]], Central and Eastern Europe, North America, and the Caribbean<ref>Biography [http://www.youthmeetingrome.com/?cont=speak_donnell.html]</ref>. 

At the end of the [[Cold War]], he was requested in late 1991 to launch a rapid response capability for deploying UN Volunteers (UNV) to UN emergency operations worldwide. He overhauled recruitment methods, and oversaw the rapid deployment of thousands of UN volunteers to crisis zones, where they became the front-line link between relief and aid delivery agencies such as [[UNICEF]], [[UNHCR]], [[WFP]], [[UNDP]], and [[WHO]] and suffering war victims, [[refugees]] and internal displacees. The effort saved lives during the years 1992-1994 in [[Afghanistan]], [[Angola]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]], [[Cambodia]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Kenya]], [[Liberia]], [[Rwanda]], [[Somalia]], [[Sudan]], and many other war-torn countries during the raging inter-ethnic tragedies that succeeded the Cold War's proxy conflicts. True life stories from the field featured in ''Volunteers Against Conflict'', a book praised by former Presidents [[Nelson Mandela]], [[Mary Robinson]], and [[Jimmy Carter]], and written by volunteers recruited under his leadership.
[[Image:BBG & ODs.jpg|thumb|right|Boutros-Ghali & O'Donnell, Ankara, end-May 1996]]
Based later in [[Turkey]], he helped assure the humanitarian corridor through Turkey into northern [[Iraq]] after the first [[Gulf War]] from 1994–1996, and coordinated earthquake relief in Turkey itself. Subsequently he held a senior emergency management role in [[UNDP]] headquarters in New York, and later lead a systemic governance team for crisis countries, developing a new policy approach to tackle root causes for preventing crisis in vulnerable countries.

In 2000, he played an important role in leading missions that helped the late [[Sergio Vieira de Mello]] lay the foundations for public administration capacity in [[East Timor]] before independence. He organised a landmark workshop with the Timorese leadership on 1 March 2000, leading to a reform of the UN mission by the Security Council<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=aoju8RjxkHMC&pg=RA1-PA341&lpg=RA1-PA341&dq=%22francis+m.+o'donnell%22&source=bl&ots=Xlo-8O49D2&sig=AvtgqPE82g7ZxrBTSD33qllJwX8&hl=en&ei=ksLoSrORGqKQjAeR-qm2CA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CBMQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&q=%22francis%20m.%20o'donnell%22&f=false Craig N.

In late 2000, he landed in Belgrade [http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/rwb.nsf/AllDocsByUNID/5f39f9794ba9318cc1256bdb00459dec] in the immediate aftermath of the overthrow of [[Slobodan Milošević]], and supported the new democratic forces in bringing stability to the remnant of the former [[Yugoslavia]] (Serbia and Montenegro), preventing nascent conflict with marginalised ethnic Albanians in the [[Preševo Valley]] of southern Serbia, launching reintegration programmes, promoting human rights, and supporting reform of governance institutions[http://www.arhiva.srbija.gov.rs/vesti/2004-02/20/343738.html] [http://www.skgo.org/reports/734] [http://www.eps.rs/publikacije/list_kwh/2002/list_br_334.pdf], and bolstering civil society<ref>[http://www.royalfamily.org/statements/state-det/state-1016.htm  ''The Thirtieth Meeting of NGOs in the Royal Palace'', The Chancellery of HRH Crown Prince Alexander II of Yugoslavia, Belgrade, 16 September 2004]</ref>. In 2002, he was appointed by the UN [[Secretary-General]] [[Kofi Annan]] as Resident Coordinator of the UN system [http://www.un.org.rs][http://www.undp.org.rs] in Yugoslavia/Serbia-Montenegro, and later again in Ukraine in October 2004, just before the so-called [[Orange Revolution]]. He also contributed to housing sector policy in south-east Europe <ref>Housing in South Eastern Europe - solving a puzzle of challenges, published jointly by World Bank and Council of Europe Development Bank, Paris, March 2004 [http://www.coebank.org/pdf/gb/Housing_in_SEE.pdf](page 87)</ref>.

He presented his credentials to the President of Ukraine on 16 November 2004. As Resident Coordinator, he was the designated representative of the UN Secretary-General and lead the UN Country Team of UN agencies [http://www.un.org.ua/] and related bodies and was ''primus inter pares'' amongst several such accredited UN system ''chefs de mission diplomatique''<ref>[http://www.mfa.gov.ua/mfa/en/publication/content/1945.htm  Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine], Diplomatic List</ref>.  The [[2007 Ukrainian political crisis]], which lasted from April to June of 2007 was part of political stand off between coalition and opposition factions of [[Verkhovna Rada]] that led to the unscheduled [[Ukrainian parliamentary election, 2007]], and started on April 2, 2007 as a culmination of long lasting crisis and degradation of the parliamentary coalition when the [[President of Ukraine]] ([[Viktor Yushchenko]]) attempted to dissolve the parliament.  The following day, in light of impending political unrest, O'Donnell as [[United Nations]] [[Resident Coordinator]], and following an earlier call to deepen democracy and liberalize the economy[http://www.un.org.ua/en/information-centre/news/352-2007-03-21], exceptionally issued an advisory statement of principles on behalf of the Country Team[http://www.un.org.ua/files/unct_ukraine_statement_en.pdf] (followed by a visit by former Estonian President [[Arnold Rüütel]] on 23 April[http://www.un.org.ua/en/information-centre/news/364-2007-04-24]). 

O'Donnell called for greater awareness of the [[Holocaust]][http://www.ncsj.org/AuxPages/Wkly090130.pdf] <ref>[http://www.un.org.ua/en/news/2009-01-26/ UN-Ukraine Press Release '' UN Office in Ukraine and Ukrainian Centre for Holocaust Studies hold Round table dedicated to International Day of Commemoration in Memory of the Victims of the Holocaust'', 29 January 2009]</ref> and active tolerance and decried discrimination against Jews<ref>[http://www.jstandard.com/content/author/jewish New Jersey Jewish Standard, ''UN Holocaust Discussion in Ukraine'', 31 December 2007]</ref>,  Muslims, migrants and minorities in many countries<ref>[http://www.kmu.gov.ua/control/en/publish/article?art_id=49251313&cat_id=32598  ''United Nations Coordinator in Ukraine Francis O'Donnell urges world nations to remember tragedy of Holocaust and stick to tolerance principles'',  Web Portal of Ukrainian Government, 27 September 2006]</ref>. He was also instrumental in tackling racism and [[xenophobia]] in Ukraine, by taking the leadership in organizing regular consultations and meetings with the representatives of diplomatic missions and international organizations and jointly bringing this issue to the attention of Government<ref>[http://www.un.org.ua/files/rc_statement_udhr_conference.pdf  Statement at the International Conference ''Current Challenges of Human Rights and Freedoms'' devoted to the 60th anniversary of the ''Universal Declaration of Human Rights'' and 10th anniversary of the Ombudsman institute establishement in Ukraine, Kyiv, Ukraine 14 April 2008]</ref>. An ambassadorial working group was formed<ref>[http://www.un.org.ua/en/news/2007-06-19/  Ukrainian Celebrities Speak Out Against Racism and Xenophobia, UN website in Ukraine, 19 June 2007]</ref>  and a [[Multiculturalism|Diversity]] Initiative, a coordination group under the leadership of the [[International Organization for Migration|IOM]] and [[UNHCR]], was established to provide a forum for anti-discrimination policies – with the overall objective to create a consolidated response to racism and xenophobia in Ukraine. As a result of concerted efforts, the Government stepped up its response to this challenge; an official repudiation of racism by President [[Viktor Yuschenko]] issued; the Government adopted an Action Plan on Counteraction to Racism; and the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) established a special unit to counteract xenophobia and intolerance<ref>[http://soderkoping.org.ua/page16293.html The Söderköping Process,  ''Xenophobia is on the agenda on inter-government meeting in Ukraine'', Kyiv, 13 November 2007]</ref>. Policy advice was provided and  best practices from European countries was shared with Government.  There was a wide-scale information campaign, including broadcasting of public service announcements<ref>[http://www.undg.org/docs/RCAR/2007/UKR/Letter-to-SG.final.final.doc    ''UNCT Ukraine Annual Report for 2007 and prospects for 2008'', Letter to the Secretary-General, 21 February 2008]</ref>.

O'Donnell also oversaw the establishment and implementation of the large EU Border Assistance Mission between [[Moldova]] and Ukraine, which brought about substantial improvements in border management, including a curtailing of human trafficking, illicit weapons and other contraband smuggling, and corruption<ref>[http://www.undp.org.ua/news-and-multimedia/1-undp-news/344?lang=en-GB&Itemid=75&option=com_content&view=article&catid=1:undp-news&id=344&month=4&year=2007&Itemid=518   UNDP, EU to further help Ukraine modernise border management, UNDP, 13 March 2007]</ref>.

She credited him that UN institutions repeatedly rendered support to the Foundation’s initiatives related to education and culture.  Also in 2007, the Ukraine 3000 International Charitable Foundation joined the [[United Nations Global Compact]].

==Public life==
Since the early 1990s, he was actively involved in promoting global peace services [http://www.globalpeaceservices.org/] and inter-faith dialogue, with World Peacemakers (see [http://www.worldpeacemakers.org/]) and the [[United States Agency for International Development]], Global Alliance of Peace Services, the Life and Peace Institute (see [http://www.life-peace.org/default2.asp?xid=]), the Swedish Christian Council, [[Pax Christi]]<ref>[http://storage.paxchristi.net/NL32E95.pdf  Pax Christi Newsletter nr. 32], May 1995</ref>, International Alert, and others. 

He has also addressed public and expert audiences, and delivered keynote addresses at several international conferences. He delivered an address (see [http://www.un.org.ua/?p=news&article=693]) to the XXII International Congress on the Family in Kiev, Ukraine (see [http://www.zakonmaltanski.pl/index.php?go=news17]), and more recently was guest speaker at the Conference for Young Christian Professionals held in [[Rome]] on 28–30 November 2008, where he addressed the subject of'' Leadership Challenges in the Service of Society''<ref>[http://www.youthmeetingrome.com/?cont=speak_donnell.html     ''Leadership Challenges in the Service of Society'', statement at the International Youth Meeting in Rome,  28-30 November 2008]</ref>.  The conference was targeted at ""socially active young people, those who are not afraid to discuss the challenges and problems of modern life and who would like to find solutions in the spirit of [[Pope John Paul II]]’s call to ‘build a civilisation of love’, i.e. young people between the ages of 25- 35, in particular the peers of the pontificate of Pope John Paul II"".  Several of his papers have been published and he has contributed chapters to several published works on peace and governance issues. 

He has appeared on national TV and radio programmes in several developing countries and in [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Turkey]], as well as on Irish [[RTE]], UK Radio-4 (see [http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/]), KRTV (see [http://www.krtvonline.com/]) and FOX NEWS (USA) (see [http://www.foxnews.com/]), and on the [[BBC]] and [[CNN]], Serbian and Montenegrin TV channels (RTS, B92, Beta), and Ukrainian TV as well as in various print media.

His monograph is lodged in the National Archives of Ireland, and acknowledged in the published White Paper (1996). He is member of the Institute of International and European Affairs (see [http://www.iiea.com/eventsx.php?event_id=163]). 

His analysis of the historical evolution of the law affecting incorporeal hereditaments as elements of intangible [[cultural heritage]] (see [http://portal.unesco.org/culture/en/ev.php-URL_ID=2225&URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&URL_SECTION=201.html]) has also been acknowledged by the Law Reform Commission [http://www.lawreform.ie/] in Ireland, during its consideration of the repeal of 150 statutes going back to 1285 (see [http://www.lawreform.ie/Report%20on%20Reform%20and%20Modernisation%20of%20Land%20Law.pdf]). Since mid-2006, the consequent Bill on Land Reform & Conveyancing has progressed in the [[Oireachtas]], and been adopted into law, as the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act, Number 27 of 2009 [http://www.oireachtas.ie/viewdoc.asp?DocID=13018&CatID=87], with such hereditaments preserved as personal rights when held in gross.

===The Editor===
The editor is accessed by pressing F1 in developer mode and allows the creation and editing of new or existing levels in the game. In case there are black bars in the interface, the mouse pointer needs to be moved further down to be able to click on the NEW/LOAD/SAVE buttons and other UI elements while in the editor.

To save new levels, a folder called Levels needs to be created in the Super Meat Boy directory. Please note not to start the new level immediately; instead, when starting the game, add the command-line: -palette palettefile.lp

palettefile.lp can be one of the following:
*4bit1.lp
*end.lp

'''Ann Radcliffe''' (9 July 1764 – 7 February 1823) was an English [[author]], and considered the pioneer of the [[Gothic fiction|gothic novel]] (although she was not the first to publish a book of this style). Her style is romantic in its vivid descriptions of landscapes, and long travel scenes, yet the Gothic element is obvious through her use of the supernatural. It was her triumph of reason, and explanation of the seemingly inexplicable supernatural that helped the Gothic novel to become culturally acceptable.
Very little is known of Ann Radcliffe's life. The Edinburgh Review, published in 1823 (the year of her death) said of her: 'She never appeared in public, nor mingled in private society, but kept herself apart, like the sweet bird that sings its solitary notes, shrouded and unseen‘ (Facer). Christina Rossetti attempted to write a biography about her life, but abandoned it for lack of information. 
As far as is known, there are no images available of Ann Radcliffe. The one on this page is popularly circulated on the internet, but is a stock image, and not a resemblance of Radcliffe. According to Ruth Facer: “Physically, she was said to be 'exquisitely proportioned' – quite short, complexion beautiful 'as was her whole countenance, especially her eyes, eyebrows and mouth‘” (Facer).
Radcliffe was born as Ann Ward in [[Holborn]], [[London]] on July 9th, 1964. Her father was William Ward, a haberdasher (who later moved to Bath to managed a China shop); her mother was Ann Oates. In 1787, she married Oxford graduate and journalist William Radcliffe, part-owner and editor of the English Chronicle. He often came home late, and to occupy her time she began to write and read her work to him when he returned home. They had a childless, but seemingly happy marriage. Ann called him her 'nearest relative and friend' (Facer). Later they traveled together, along with their dog, Chance, using profits from her novels. When Ann died on  February 7th, 1823, there were some reports that she was insane. However, her husband adamantly claimed that she had died of an asthma attack.
==Literary Life==
Ann's fiction is characterized by seemingly supernatural events being explained through reason. Throughout her work traditional morals are asserted, women’s rights are advocated for, and reason prevails.
Ann published 6 novels in all. These are (listed alphabetically): ''The Castles of Athlin and Dunbayne, Gaston de Blondeville, The Italian, The Mysteries of Udolpho, The Romance of the Forest and A Sicilian Romance''. She also published a book of poetry, but her talent for prose far exceeded her poetic ability. 
Radcliffe is considered to be the founder of Gothic Literature. While there were others that preceded her, Radcliffe was the one that legitimized Gothic literature. Sir Walter Scott called her the'founder of a class or school‘ (Facer). Radcliffe's novel, ''The Mysteries of Udolpho'', was parodied by Jane Austin in ''Northanger Abbey''. Radcliffe did not like where Gothic literature was headed, and her final novel, ''The Italian'', was written in response to Matthew Gregory Lewis's ''The Monk''. It is assumed that this frustration is what caused Radcliffe to cease writing. 
Ann Radcliffe had a profound influence on many later authors. These include: The Marquis de Sade (1740-1814), Edgar Allan Poe (1809-1849) and Sir Walter Scott (1771-1832). Sir Walter Scott also interspersed his work with poems, as did Radcliffe.
==Art Connection==
Radcliffe's elaborate description of landscapes was influenced by the painters Claude Lorraine and Salvador Rosa. She often wrote about places she had never been. Lorraine's influence can be seen through Radcliffe's picturesque, romantic descriptions of landscapes, as seen in volume one of ''The Mysteries of Udolpho''. Rosa's influence can be seen through dark landscapes and elements of the Gothic.
Radcliffe said of Lorraine: 


''“In a shaded corner, near the chimney, a most exquisite Claude, an evening view, perhaps over the Campagna of Rome. The sight of this picture imparted much of the luxurious repose and satisfaction, which we derive from contemplating the finest scenes of nature. Here was the poet, as well as the painter, touching the imagination, and making you see more than the picture contained. You saw the real light of the sun, you breathed the air of the country, you felt all the circumstances of a luxurious climate on the most serene and beautiful landscape; and the mind thus softened, you almost fancied you hear Italian music in the air” (Facer).''

'''Ann Radcliffe''' (9 July 1764 – 7 February 1823) was an English [[author]], a pioneer of the [[Gothic fiction|gothic novel]]. She published as '''Mrs. Radcliffe'''. It was her technique of the explained supernatural, in which every seemingly supernatural intrusion is eventually traced back to natural causes, and the impeccable conduct of her heroines that finally met with the approval of the reviewers, transforming the gothic novel into something socially acceptable.
Radcliffe was born as Ann Ward in [[Holborn]], [[London]]. Her father was William Ward, a haberdasher; her mother was Ann Oates. At the age of 22, she married journalist William Radcliffe, owner and editor of the ''[[English Chronicle]]'', in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] in 1788. The marriage was childless and, to amuse herself, she began to write fiction, which her husband encouraged.
She published ''[[The Castles of Athlin and Dunbayne]]'' in 1789. It set the tone for the majority of her work, which tended to involve innocent, but heroic young women who find themselves in gloomy, mysterious castles ruled by even more mysterious barons with dark pasts.
Her works were extremely popular among the upper class and the growing [[middle class]], especially among young women. Her works included ''[[A Sicilian Romance]]'' (1790), ''[[The Romance of the Forest]]'' (1791), ''[[The Mysteries of Udolpho]]'' (1794), and ''[[The Italian (novel)|The Italian]]'' (1797). She published a travelogue, ''[[A Journey Through Holland and the Western Frontier of Germany]]'' in 1795.
The success of ''[[The Romance of the Forest]]'' established Radcliffe as the leading exponent of the historical [[Gothic romance]]. Her later novels met with even greater attention, and produced many imitators, and famously, [[Jane Austen]]'s [[burlesque (genre)|burlesque]] of ''[[The Mysteries of Udolpho]]'' in ''[[Northanger Abbey]]'', as well as influencing the works of [[Sir Walter Scott]].
Stylistically, Radcliffe was noted for her vivid descriptions of exotic and sinister locales, though in reality the author had rarely or never visited the actual locations. Shy by nature, she did not encourage her fame and abandoned literature as a pursuit.
She died in London on 7 February 1823 from respiratory problems probably caused by [[pneumonia]]. The funeral took place in [[St George's, Hanover Square|Saint George's Church]], [[Hanover Square, London|Hanover Square]] in [[London]].
==In popular culture==
[[Paul Féval, père]] used her as his protagonist in the novel ''La Ville Vampire'' (translated as ''[http://www.blackcoatpress.com/vampirecity.htm Vampire City]'').
In the film ''[[Becoming Jane]]'', she is portrayed by [[Helen McCrory]], in a scene where she meets [[Jane Austen]] and encourages her to embark on a writing career (there is no historical evidence of such a meeting, though as noted Radcliffe's works had clearly influenced Austen's).
In [[Maria Edgeworth]]'s book ''[[Belinda]]'', Lady Delacour remarks on Clarence Hervey's letters, ""Here, my love, if you like description...here is a Radcliffean tour along the picturesque coasts of [[Dorset]] and [[Devon]]shire.""
A biography of Radcliffe, by Deborah Rogers, was published in 1996.

==Mythological Significance==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2009}}
Bhagdattpuram (now Bhagalpur) was one of the most influential towns in ""Aryavarta"" (as India was known as at that time). It is supposed to have been concurrent to Patliputra or [[Patna]]. Bhagdattpuram finds its mention in the [[Vedas]] and [[Ramayana]] as well. It is supposed to be the kingdom of Daanvir [[Karna]], the son of Kunti and the Sun God. Under his rule, the town was known as ""Anga Pradesh"" or ""Angadesh"". The word Bhagdattpuram literally means ""City of Good Luck.""

[[Mount Mandara]], situated 52 kilometres (approximately 32 miles) south from Bhagalpur on Bausi Road, is believed to have been used as the churner during [[Samudra-Manthan]] (churning of the sea) by the Gods and Demons ([[Danava]]) according to [[Hindu mythology]]. Mandara is associated with Samudra-Manthan which suggests that the hill was used by the gods to churn the ocean to procure [[amrit]]. The serpent, [[Vasuki]] offered to serve as the rope and has left behind an impression of the coil on the granite hill. It is believed that [[Panchjanya]], the conch shell used in the [[Mahabharat]] was discovered here in the ""Shankh Kund"". The Puranas also refer to the hill. It is believed to have been visited by Vishnu as [[Madhusudana]] (the destroyer of Madhu the Demon). It is said that Vishnu covered Madhu under the hill after defeating him to death. Kalidasa's [[Kumarasambhava]] refers to foot marks of [[Vishnu]] on the slopes of Mandara. The hill is replete with relics of bygone ages. Apart from inscriptions and statues, there are numerous rock cut sculptures depicting various images of Hindu Gods. The hill is equally revered by the [[Jainism|Jains]] who believe that their 12th [[Tirthankara]] attained nirvana at the summit. The area around Mandara Hill is laced with a landscape of extraordinary splendour. The 800 feet high granite hill is a sight to see in the daylight. It is a popular picnic spot for people living in the area.

The Beatsteaks are mentioned by [[Die Ärzte]] in their song ''[[Unrockbar]]'', which helped increase the reputation of the Beatsteaks suddenly. The text reads: ''""How can you keep sitting quietly to the Beatsteaks, when schlager singers let tears come to your eyes?""'' Die Ärzte dedicated their song ''Popstar'' to the Beatsteaks at [[Rock am Ring]] 2007. Singer Teutoburg-Weiß challenged ''Die Ärzte'' jokingly with calling the Beatsteaks the ""best band in the universe"" the day before, referring to ''Die Ärzte'''s claim to be the ''best band of the world''. Both bands are in a friendly rivalry in [[Berlin]].

The Beatsteaks are present on the 2005 sampler ''On the Run'' of the human rights group [[Pro Asyl]] with a cover of ''Opel Gang'' from [[Die Toten Hosen]]. They in return covered the song ''Hand in Hand'' from the album [[Smack Smash]] and released it on their unplugged album. The Rock-'n'-Roll band ''Boppin'B'' also covered the song on their latest LP ''Rock 'n' Roll Radio''.

In the film [[Knallhart]] by [[Detlev Buck]] the song ''Fool'' from the album [[48/49]] can be heard. 

In the film [[Extreme Ops]] the song ''Not Ready To Rock'' from the album [[Living Targets]] can be heard.

After the singer in the Berlin bands [[Seeed]] and [[Boundzound]], ''Demba Nabé'', could be seen in the music videos to the Beatsteaks singles ''I Don't Care As Long As You Sing'' and, dressed as a ninja, in ''Hello Joe'', Arnim returns the favour with a guest role in the video for the single ''Boundzound Stay Alive''.

They also support the Germany based Fairtrade T-shirt company, [[Armedangels]], and can often be seen wearing their t-shirts.<ref>http://www.armedangels.de/de/community/stars.html</ref>

Al Swanson, soon ban her from when she disobeys instructions and hand to him.

En una noche oscura
con ansias en amores inflamada,
¡oh dichosa ventura!,
salí sin ser notada
estando ya mi casa sosegada

A oscuras y segura
por la secreta escala, disfrazada,
¡oh dichosa ventura!,
a oscuras y en celada,
estando ya mi casa sosegada.

En la noche dichosa,
en secreto que nadie me veía
ni yo miraba cosa
sin otra luz y guía
sino la que en el corazón ardía.

Aquesta me guiaba
más cierto que la luz de mediodía
adonde me esperaba
quien yo bien me sabía
en parte donde nadie parecía.

¡Oh noche, que guiaste!
¡Oh noche amable más que la alborada!
¡Oh noche que juntaste
amado con amada,
amada en el amado transformada!

En mi pecho florido,
que entero para él solo se guardaba
allí quedó dromido
y yo le regalaba
y el ventalle de cedros aire daba.

El aire de la almena
cuando yo sus cabellos esparcía
con su mano serena
en mi cuello hería
y todos mis sentidos suspendía.

Quedéme y olvidéme;
el rostro recliné sobre el amado;
cesó todo, y dejéme
dejando mi cuidado
entre las azucenas olvidado.

==Current campaigns==
Anti-Slavery International is working on a campaign in the [[Human trafficking in the Philippines|Philippines]] concerning the forced labor and exploitation of domestic workers. In the Philippines the Domestic Workers Bill or Batas Kasambahay, was passed in 1995 to ensure the safety and just treatment of domestic workers. The bill if properly enforced would help to regulate and monitor the treatment of domestic workers. Anti-Slavery International is supporting the government in the Philippines to pass the bill into law and is pushing the government to prioritize this legislation for the safety of its people.

==Significant cases in recent history==
On November 19, 2008 [[Nujood Ali|Nujood Mohammed Ali]] was honored for her campaigns against forced early marriage in Yemen. Glamour Magazine named Nujood 'Woman of the Year' for her efforts, shortly after she divorced her own husband of more than 3 years. Nujood herself was the victim of an arranged and forced marriage. Though in Yemen the legal age to marry is 15, the economic conditions prove it more economically convenient to have one less mouth to feed and marry them off as girls. Nujood was married off from her economically struggling family at age nine. The agreement between her father and a local motorcycle courier was that Nujood would marry him with the stipulation that he would not consummate the marriage until she had reached puberty. But like most forced early marriages, Nujood was raped and often beaten. Nujood somehow escaped and proceeded to get the marriage annulled. Her victory in receiving the divorce from her abuse helped to draw attention to the brutality and cruelty children face. Nujood has now returned to school and wants to one day become a lawyer to protect the rights of children.",False,0,0

During his seven year tenure, Momoh welcomed the spread of unchecked corruption and complete economic collapse. Unable to pay its civil servants, those desperate enough ransacked and looted government offices and property. Even in Freetown, important commodities like gasoline were scarce. But the government hit rock bottom when it could not no longer pay schoolteachers and the education system collapsed. Since only wealthy families could afford to pay private tutors, the bulk of Sierra Leone’s youth during the late 1980s roamed the streets aimlessly. Furthermore, a falling tax base and increased state demands encouraged chiefs to fine an ever increasingly frustrated population. As infrastructure and public ethics deteriorated in tandem, much of Sierra Leone’s professional class fled the country. By 1991, Sierra Leone was ranked as one of the poorest countries in the world, even though it benefited from ample natural resources including diamonds, gold, bauxite, rutile, iron ore, fish, coffee, and cocoa.   
The RUF used funds harvested from the alluvial diamond mines to purchase weapons and ammunition from neighboring Guinea, Liberia, and even SLA soldiers. Furthermore, the lack of external support made the control of the alluvial diamond mines that much more important. But the most significant connection between diamonds and war is that the presence of easily extractable diamonds provided an incentive for violence. To maintain control of important mining districts like Kono, thousands of civilians were expelled and kept away from these important economic centers. 
Although diamonds were a significant motivating and sustaining factor, there were other means of profiting from the civil war. For instance, gold mining was prominent in some regions. Even more common was cash crop farming through the use of forced labor. Looting during the Sierra Leone Civil War did not just center on diamonds, but also included that of currency, household items, food, livestock, cars, and international aid shipments. For Sierra Leoneans that did not have access to arable land, joining the rebel cause was an opportunity to seize property through the use of deadly force. But the most important reason why the civil war should not be entirely attributed to conflict over the economic benefits incurred from the alluvial diamond mines is that the pre-war frustrations and grievances did not just concern that of the diamond sector. Contrary to some notable political economists, the root cause of SLCW was poor governance, poverty, and corruption, and the failure to create institutions that protected the freedoms of individual citizens.         
==Chronology of the Sierra Leone Civil War ==
=== The RUF/NPFL Incursion ===
On March 23rd 1991, The RUF, with support from the special forces of Charles Taylor’s revolutionary army, the National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL), invaded Eastern Sierra Leone. As the armies moved towards the interior of the country they looted, raped, and murdered innocent civilians causing a massive refugee movement into the neighboring countries of Liberia and Guinea. The RUF’s control of Sierra Leone’s valuable alluvial diamond mines in the Eastern and Southern corridors of the country were critical for funding the rebellion. In need of arms and ammunition, Sankoh bartered the diamonds to Taylor in return for weapons, equipment, and medical supplies. Sankoh believed that if he could stop the government’s mining efforts then the government would cease to function. Economic motivations were undeniably in an important factor in the initial RUF incursion from neighboring Liberia. Individual Liberian and Burkinabe mercenaries sought loot in Sierra Leone as well as involvement in the mining of Sierra Leone’s alluvial diamonds.  In return for their support, Sankoh even endorsed theft, rape, and murder The village of Koindo was a key target for the rebels during the initial incursion because it was an important staging point for smuggling between Sierra Leone and Liberia.
 
The initial rebellion could have easily been quelled in the first half of 1991. But the RUF – despite being both numerically inferior and extremely brutal against civilians – controlled two-thirds of Sierra Leone by the year’s end. The SLA’s equally poor behavior made this outcome possible. Often afraid to directly confront or unable to locate the elusive RUF, government soldiers were brutal and indiscriminate in their search for rebels or sympathizers among the civilian population.  After retaking captured towns, the SLA would perform a ‘mopping up’ operation in which the towns people were transported to concentration camp styled ‘strategic hamlets’ far from their homes in Eastern and Southern Sierra Leone under the pretense of separating the population from the insurgents. However in many cases, this was followed by much looting and theft after the people were evacuated. This inevitably led to the alienation of many civilians and pushed some Sierra Leoneans to join the rebel cause. For these reasons, civilians increasingly relied on the local militias for their protection. 
==National Provisional Ruling Council Coup==
Within one year of fighting, the RUF offensive had stalled, but it still remained in control of large territories in Eastern and Southern Sierra Leone leaving many villages unprotected while also disrupting food and government diamond production. Soon the government was unable to pay both its civil servants and the SLA. As a result, the Momoh regime lost all remaining credibility and a group of disgruntled junior officers led by Captain Valentine Strasser overthrew the government on April 29th, 1992. Strasser justified the coup and the establishment of the National Provisional Ruling Council (NPRC) by referencing the corrupt Momoh regime and its inability to resuscitate the economy, provide for the people of Sierra Leone, and repel the rebel invaders. The NPRC’s coup was largely popular because it promised to bring peace to Sierra Leone (ibid.: 102). But the NPRC’s promise would prove to be short lived.  
In March of 1993, with much help from ECOMOG troops provided by Nigeria, the SLA recaptured the Koidu and Kono diamond districts and pushed the RUF to the Sierra Leone – Liberia border. The RUF was facing supply problems as the United Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy (ULIMO) gains inside Liberia were restricting Charles Taylor’s NPFL’s ability to trade with the RUF.By the end of 1993, many observers thought that the war was over because for the first time in the conflict the Sierra Leone Army was able to establish itself in the Eastern and the Southern mining districts.
However, with senior government officials neglectful of the conditions faced by SLA soldiers, front line soldiers became resentful of their poor conditions and began helping themselves to Sierra Leone’s rich natural resources. This included alluvial diamonds as well as looting and ‘sell game’, a tactic in which government forces would withdraw from a town but not before leaving arms and ammunition for the roving rebels in return for cash. Abraham suggests that both sides not only had an interest in looting for personal enrichment, but also had a reason to collude so that the strained RUF could remain a formidable fighting force, prolonging the war to the benefit of both parties. Renegade SLA soldiers even clashed with crack Kamajor units on a number of occasions when the Kamajors intervened to halt the looting and mining. Furthermore, an end to the fighting would have made elections a certainty, ending the benefits that the NPRC military elites gained from holding office. Instead of working towards ending the war once and for all, SLA soldiers and NPRC elites seemed to be acting to prolong it. The war dragged on as a low intensity conflict until January of 1995 when RUF forces and dissident SLA elements seized the Sierromco and Sierra Rutile diamond mines in the South West, furthering the government’s economic struggles and enabling a renewed RUF advance on the capital at Freetown.   
==Enter Executive Outcomes==
In March 1995, the South African mercenary group EO arrived in Sierra Leone when the RUF was within twenty miles of Freetown (Keen, 2005:49). As a military force, EO was extremely skilled and conducted a highly successful counter insurgency against the RUF. In just ten days of fighting, EO was able to drive the RUF forces back sixty miles into the interior of the country. EO outmatched the RUF forces in all operations. In just seven months, EO, with support from loyal SLA and the Kamajors battalions, recaptured the diamond mining districts and the Kangari Hills, a major RUF stronghold. A second offensive captured the provincial capital and the largest city in Sierra Leone and destroyed the RUF’s main base of operations near Bo, finally forcing the RUF to admit defeat and sign the Abidjan Peace Accord. The hiring of EO demonstrates that some elements within the National Provisional Ruling Council still wanted to repel the RUF invasion. Another explanation is that the NPRC simply desired to protect the capital (and themselves) while regaining control of the profitable mining districts. In short, the efforts of EO forced Sankoh to cut his losses and enter into a cease fire and peace process. This period of relative peace also allowed the country to hold parliamentary elections in which [[Ahmad Tejan Kabbah]], a diplomat who had worked at the UN for more than 20 years, won the presidential election. Because of the prevailing war conditions, parliamentary elections were conducted, for the first time, under the system of proportional representation. Thirteen political parties participated, with the SLPP winning 27 seats, UNPP 17, PDP 12, APC 5 and DCP 3. Two months later, discussions began between the Sierra Leone People's Party (SLPP)and the RUF in the town of [[Yamoussoukro]], which led eventually to the signing of the [[Abidjan Peace Accord]] in [[Abidjan]], [[Côte d'Ivoire]] on 30 November 1996. 
==Abidjan Peace Accord==
The Abidjan Peace Agreement was signed on November 30th, 1996 . Importantly, Abidjan mandated that EO was to pull out in five weeks after the arrival of a neutral peacekeeping force. However, it soon became clear Sankoh and other hardline elements within the RUF did not want peace. The main stumbling block that prevented Sankoh from signing the agreement sooner was the number and type of peacekeepers that were to monitor the ceasefire. Had the RUF leadership legitimately wanted to end the conflict, they would have requested more, not fewer, peacekeepers. Despite the RUF’s loss of strongholds in the Kangari hills and Kailahun districts and widespread food and ammunition shortages, many rebels still did not surrender because they were extremely fearful of retribution from the now ruling Kabbah regime and Kamajor reprisals. In January of 1997, the new democratically elected government of Sierra Leone – beset by demands to reduce expenditures by the IMF – ordered EO to leave the country, even though a neutral monitoring force had yet to arrive. In short, the embryonic peace process began to collapse almost as soon as Abidjan was signed because continued Kamajor attacks and the fear of punitive tribunals following demobilization kept many rebels in the bush despite their dire situation. 
==Armed Forces Revolutionary Council/RUF Coup and Interregnum==
On March 25th, 1997, a group of disgruntled SLA officers freed and armed 600 prisoners from the Pademba Road prison in Freetown. One of the prisoners, Major Johnny Paul Koroma, emerged as the leader of the coup and the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC) – the new GoSL. After blessing from the now captured and imprisoned Foday Sankoh, RUF fighters – which were supposedly on their last legs – were ordered out of the bush to participate in the coup. Without hesitation and encountering only light resistance from SLA loyalists, 5,000 rag-tag rebel fighters marched 100 miles and overran the capital. Without fear or reluctance, RUF and SLA dissidents then proceeded to parade peacefully together. In short, the coup had been planned in conjunction with the RUF leadership. Koroma then invited Sankoh to join his government, and appointed him Deputy Charirman of Mining after appealing to Nigeria (where he was imprisoned) for his release. The joint AFCR/RUF leadership then proclaimed that the war had been won, and a great wave of looting and reprisals against civilians in Freetown under the auspice of: ‘Operation Pay Yourself’ followed. ). According to Human Rights Watch, 7,635 corpses were buried as a result of the January 1999 incursion into Freetown. President Kabbah, surrounded only by his bodyguards, left by helicopter for exile in nearby Guinea. 
Condemning the AFRC coup, ECOMOG forces demanded that the new junta return power peacefully to the Kabbah government or risk sanctions and increased military presence. Starting at the Lungi aiport, ECOMOG forces formed a three-pronged attack that surrounded the capital of Freetown. Overcoming entrenched AFCR positions, the ECOMOG forces retook the capital and reinstated the Kabbah government but let the rebels flee without further harassment. However, the regions lying just beyond Freetown proved much more difficult to pacify. Thanks impart to bad road conditions, lack of support aircraft, and a revenge driven rebel force, ECOMOG’s offensive ground to a halt just outside Freetown. ECOMOG’s forces suffered from several weakness, the most important being, poor command and control, low morale, poor training in counterinsurgency, low manpower, limited air and sea capability, finally poor funding, and finally like EO before it failed to provide law and order in the wake of conflict.  In summation, ECOMOG’s intervention in Sierra Leone brought a tentative peace that also reestablished the Kabbah regime through negotiated talks with the RUF/AFCR rebels. Unable to push the AFCR/RUF rebels from South and Eastern Sierra Leone, the Kabbah regime was forced to make serious concessions in the coming year.

==Lome Peace Agreement==
Given that Nigeria was due to recall its ECOMOG forces without achieving a tactical victory over the RUF, the international community intervened diplomatically to promote negotiations between the RUF/AFRC rebels and the newly reinstated Kabbah regime . The Lome Peace Agreement, signed on July 7th, 1999 is controversial in that Sankoh was pardoned for treason, granted official status at the Vice President, and made chairman of the commission that oversaw the entirety of Sierra Leone’s diamond mines . In return, the RUF was ordered to demobilize and disarm its armies through a process of disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration process monitored by an international peacekeeping force which would initially be under both ECOMOG and the [[United Nations]. The Lome Peace Agreement was not particularly popular with the people of Sierra Leone because Sankoh, the commander of the unimaginably brutal and treasonous RUF, was now handed the second most powerful position in the country and even more importantly, control over all of Sierra Leone’s lucrative diamond mines.

===Disarmament, Demobilization, and Reintegration Process===
Following the Lome Peace Agreement, the security situation in Sierra Leone was still unstable because many rebels refused to commit themselves to the peace process. The DDR camps were an attempt to convince the rebel forces to literally exchange their weapon for food, clothing, and shelter. During a six week quarantine period, former combatants were taught basic skills that could be put to use in a peaceful profession after they return to society. After 2001, DDR camps became increasingly effective and by 2002 it had collected over 45,000 weapons and hosted over 70,000 former combatants. 

==UNAMSIL Intervention==
Despite the ceasefire that was established by the Lome peace, several renegade elements within the RUF, like the ‘West Side Boys,’ created an unstable security situation which would require a UN intervention. Even when a 17,500 man force was organized – at the time the largest UN force in existence – and deployed in the RUF held diamond areas, they were rebuffed and humiliated; over 500 UNAMSIL peacekeepers and their armored personal carriers (APCs) were taken hostage by the RUF. On 8 May 2000, members of the RUF shot and killed as many as 20 people demonstrating against the RUF violations outside Sankoh's house in Freetown. As a result, Sankoh and other senior members of the RUF were arrested and the group was stripped of its positions in government. Now that the UNAMSIL force had essentially rearmed the RUF, a call for a new military intervention was made to save the UNAMSIL hostages and the government of Sierra Leone. For over a year later, the UNAMSIL force meticulously avoided intervening in RUF controlled mining districts lest another major incident occur. 

==British Intervention==
In May 2000, the situation in the country deteriorated to such an extent that British troops were deployed in [[Operation Palliser]] to evacuate foreign nationals and establish order. They stabilized the situation, and were the catalyst for a ceasefire and ending of the civil war. The British forces, under the command of Brigadier Richards, expanded their original mandate or just evacuating common wealth citizens and now wanted to save UNAMSIL from the brink of collapse. At the time of the British intervention in May 2000, half of the country remained under the RUF’s control.  The 1,200 man British ground force - supported by air and sea power - shifted the balance of power in favor of the government and the rebel forces were easily repelled from the areas beyond Freetown.

=End of the Sierra Leone Civil War==
Several factors led to the end of the civil war. First, Guinean cross border bombing raids against villages believed to be bases used by the RUF working in conjunction with Guinean dissidents were very effective in routing the rebels.  Additionally, a ban on Liberian diamond exports and a strengthening of the existing arms embargo prompted Liberia to distance itself from the RUF . Despite the fact that large numbers of diamonds continued to be exported from RUF controlled areas, the increased cost of trading with Liberia appears to have significantly reduced rebel profits from the diamond trade.  Another factor encouraging a less combative RUF was a UN new resolution that demanded that the government of Liberia expel all RUF members, end their financial support of the RUF, and halt the illicit diamond trade. Finally, the Kamajors, feeling less threatened now that their enemy the RUF was disintegrating in the face of a robust opponent failed to incite violence like they had done in the past. With their backs against the wall and without any international support, the RUF forces signed a new peace treaty within a matter of weeks.
 
By early 2002 , some 72,000 ex-combatants had been disarmed and demobilized, although many still awaited re-integration assistance (Cooper 2004, 110, Bell 2005). On 18 January 2002 President Kabbah declared the civil war officially over. By most estimates, over 50,000 people had lost their lives in the Sierra Leone Civil War. Countless more fell victim to the reprehensible and perverse behavior of the combatants. That May, hundreds of thousands of Sierra Leoneans reelected President Kabbah; the RUF failed to gain a single seat in parliament. Although it appears that Sierra Leone has been freed from the terror that befell neighboring Liberia, even today unemployed former combatants still threaten the peace. Although a victor was never proclaimed, it is evident that those who were involved in the Sierra Leone Civil War had gained little in the end.",,"	In 1985, Stevens stepped down, and handed the nation’s preeminent position to Major General [[Joseph Momoh]], a notoriously inept leader that also maintained the status quo. During his seven year tenure, Momoh welcomed the spread of unchecked corruption and complete economic collapse. Unable to pay its civil servants, those desperate enough ransacked and looted government offices and property. Even in Freetown, important commodities like gasoline were scarce. But the government hit rock bottom when it could not no longer pay schoolteachers and the education system collapsed. Since only wealthy families could afford to pay private tutors, the bulk of Sierra Leone’s youth during the late 1980s roamed the streets aimlessly. Furthermore, a falling tax base and increased state demands encouraged chiefs to fine an ever increasingly frustrated population. As infrastructure and public ethics deteriorated in tandem, much of Sierra Leone’s professional class fled the country. By 1991, Sierra Leone was ranked as one of the poorest countries in the world, even though it benefited from ample natural resources including diamonds, gold, bauxite, rutile, iron ore, fish, coffee, and cocoa.   
	The RUF used funds harvested from the alluvial diamond mines to purchase weapons and ammunition from neighboring Guinea, Liberia, and even SLA soldiers. Furthermore, the lack of external support made the control of the alluvial diamond mines that much more important. But the most significant connection between diamonds and war is that the presence of easily extractable diamonds provided an incentive for violence. To maintain control of important mining districts like Kono, thousands of civilians were expelled and kept away from these important economic centers. 
	Although diamonds were a significant motivating and sustaining factor, there were other means of profiting from the civil war. For instance, gold mining was prominent in some regions. Even more common was cash crop farming through the use of forced labor. Looting during the Sierra Leone Civil War did not just center on diamonds, but also included that of currency, household items, food, livestock, cars, and international aid shipments. For Sierra Leoneans that did not have access to arable land, joining the rebel cause was an opportunity to seize property through the use of deadly force. But the most important reason why the civil war should not be entirely attributed to conflict over the economic benefits incurred from the alluvial diamond mines is that the pre-war frustrations and grievances did not just concern that of the diamond sector. Contrary to some notable political economists, the root cause of SLCW was poor governance, poverty, and corruption, and the failure to create institutions that protected the freedoms of individual citizens.         
==Chronology of events==
=== A series of military coups ===
In contested elections in March 1967, the [[All Peoples Congress]] (APC) won a plurality of the parliamentary seats. Accordingly, the [[Governor-General of Sierra Leone]] (representing the Queen of Sierra Leone, [[Elizabeth II]]) declared [[Siaka Stevens]]—APC leader and Mayor of [[Freetown]]—as the new Prime Minister. Within a few hours, Stevens and Margai were placed under house arrest by [[David Lansana|Brigadier David Lansana]], the Commander of the [[Republic of Sierra Leone Military Forces]] (RSLMF), on grounds that the determination of office should await the election of the tribal representatives to the house. Another group of officers soon staged another [[coup]], only to be later ousted in a third coup, the ""sergeants’ revolt,"" and Stevens at last, in April 1968, assumed the office of Prime Minister under the restored constitution. Sierra Leone was declared a Republic in 1971, and Siaka Stevens remained as head of state until 1985. Under his rule, in 1978, the constitution was amended and all political parties, other than the ruling APC, were banned. In August 1985, the APC named military commander Major-General [[Joseph Saidu Momoh]], Stevens' own choice, as the party candidate to succeed Stevens. Momoh was elected President in a one-party referendum on 1 October 1985. In October 1991  Momoh had the constitution amended once again, re-establishing a multi-party system. Under Momoh, APC rule was increasingly marked by abuses of power.
=== The RUF ===
In March 1991, a small band of men who called themselves the [[Revolutionary United Front]] (RUF) under the leadership of a former-[[corporal]], [[Foday Sankoh]], began to attack villages in eastern Sierra Leone on the Liberian border.  On 29 April 1992, a group of young military officers, led by Capt. [[Valentine Strasser]], launched a military coup, which sent Momoh into exile in [[Guinea]] and established the [[National Provisional Ruling Council]] (NPRC).
The NPRC proved to be nearly as ineffectual as the Momoh government in repelling the RUF. More and more of the country fell to RUF fighters, so that by 1995 they held much of the countryside and were [[Siege of Freetown|on the doorstep of Freetown]]. To rectify the situation, the NUYTR hired several hundred mercenaries from the private firm [[Executive Outcomes]]. Within a month they had driven RUF fighters back to enclaves along Sierra Leone’s borders.<ref>Woods, Larry J. and Colonel Timothy R. Reese. [http://www.cgsc.edu/carl/download/csipubs/OP28.pdf ""Military Interventions in Sierra Leone: Lessons From a Failed State""], 2008, The Long War Series, Occasional Paper 28, pp. 29–30, Combat Studies Institute Press, U.S. Army Combined Arms Center, Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, accessed October 14, 2010  ISBN 0-9801236-4-X</ref>  The RUF's signature terror tactic was physical mutilation. An estimated 20,000 civilians suffered amputation, with machetes and axes being used to sever arms, legs, lips, and ears. Fighting continued in the ensuing months, with the RUF gaining control of the diamond mines in the Kono District and pushing the Sierra Leone army back towards Freetown. RUF members would often destroy villages and kill most of the civilians except a few men and boys aging anywhere from 7 to around 41. They would kill anyone that tried to escape. Other civilians were mutilated and sent to neighboring villages as a warning. They would sometimes take a few civilians as hostages to stop the military from attacking them. After the rebels ran out of supplies in a village, they would often burn it and kill whoever remained.
=== Return of civilian government ===
As a result of popular demand and mounting international pressure, the NPRC agreed to hand over power to a civilian government via presidential and parliamentary elections, which were held in April 1996. [[Ahmad Tejan Kabbah]], a diplomat who had worked at the UN for more than 20 years, won the presidential election. Because of the prevailing war conditions, parliamentary elections were conducted, for the first time, under the system of proportional representation. Thirteen political parties participated, with the SLPP winning 27 seats, UNPP 17, PDP 12, APC 5 and DCP 3. Two months later, discussions began between the Sierra Leone People's Party (SLPP)and the RUF in the town of [[Yamoussoukro]], which led eventually to the signing of the [[Abidjan Peace Accord]] in [[Abidjan]], [[Côte d'Ivoire]] on 30 November 1996. The agreement quickly broke down as the RUF could not agree on disarmament and the creation of a monitoring force.
The [[Armed Forces Revolutionary Council]] (AFRC), led by Major [[Johnny Paul Koroma]], overthrew President Kabbah on 25 May 1997, and invited the RUF to join the government. An [[arms embargo]] was imposed in [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1132|Security Council Resolution 1132]] and, after 10 months in office, the junta was ousted by the Nigerian-led Economic Community of West African States Monitoring Group ([[ECOMOG]]) forces, and the democratically elected government of President Kabbah was reinstated in March 1998. The RUF retreated to Kailahun, their longtime base. Johnny Paul Koroma was arrested in Kailahun and held with them. AFRC fighters regrouped in Koinadugu in the north and under of the leadership of SAJ Musa started moving towards Freetown. Both the Truth and Reconciliation and the judgments in the AFRC and RUF trials before the Special Court for Sierra Leone found that the relationship between the AFRC and RUF broke down shortly after the February 1998 ECOMOG intervention. As the AFRC moved towards Freetown through northern Bombali and Port Loko, they left a trail of death and destruction, including mass killings and amputations. SAJ Musa died in an explosion just outside of Freetown in late December 1998 and Alex Tamba Brima (a.k.a. Gullit) took over command. On 6 January 1999, the AFRC under Brima launched another attempt to overthrow the government, beginning the [[Siege of Freetown]]. Fighting reached parts of Freetown, leaving thousands dead and wounded. ECOMOG forces drove back the RUF attack several weeks later.
With the assistance of the international community, President Kabbah and RUF leader Sankoh negotiated the [[Lomé Peace Accord]], which was signed on 7 July 1999. The accord made Sankoh Vice President and gave other RUF members positions in the government, and called for an international peacekeeping force which would initially be under both ECOMOG and the [[United Nations]]. The UN Security Council established the [[UNAMSIL|United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone]] (UNAMSIL) in 1999, with an initial force of 6,000. ECOMOG forces departed in April 2000. Almost immediately, however, the RUF began to violate the agreement, most notably by holding hundreds of UNAMSIL personnel hostage and capturing their arms and ammunition in the first half of 2000. On 8 May 2000, members of the RUF shot and killed as many as 20 people demonstrating against the RUF violations outside Sankoh's house in Freetown. As a result, Sankoh and other senior members of the RUF were arrested and the group was stripped of its positions in government.
In May 2000, the situation in the country deteriorated to such an extent that British troops were deployed in [[Operation Palliser]] to evacuate foreign nationals and establish order. They stabilized the situation, and were the catalyst for a ceasefire and ending of the civil war.
=== End of the Civil War ===
After the events of May 2000, a new cease-fire was necessary to reinvigorate the peace process. This agreement was signed November of that year in Abuja. However, [[Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration]] did not resume, and fighting continued. In late 2000, Guinean forces entered Sierra Leone to attack RUF bases from which attacks had been launched against Liberian dissidents in Guinea. A second Abuja Agreement, in May 2001, set the stage for a resumption of DDR on a wide scale and a significant reduction in hostilities.  As disarmament progressed, the government began to reassert its authority in formerly rebel-held areas.  By early 2002 , some 72,000 ex-combatants had been disarmed and demobilized, although many still awaited re-integration assistance (Cooper 2004, 110, Bell 2005). On 18 January 2002 President Kabbah declared the civil war officially over.",False,22,0

'''Matte Displays''' are the effect of reflections from [[Electronic-Visual-Displays|display]] screens, their ergonomic effects and ways to characterize and control such reflections.

== From CRTs to LCDs ==
[[Image:Display-Reflections-1083-BS.png|thumb|200px|right|Figure 1: Railway timetable shown on a CRT display with vandal-proof cover glass, exhibiting distinct reflections from ambient light sources (sky, lamps). The visual information can only be read (with very low contrast) in the regions with shadow.]]

[[Image:Glossy-Matte-394-S1.png|thumb|200px|right|Figure 3: Visual information in the presence of reflections with glossy (left) and matte surface (right). The arrows indicate the position of the light source (fluorescent tube) reflected in the display.]]

The obvious difference between reflections of ambient light sources in a CRT monitor and an LCD monitor is illustrated in fig. 3. The left half of the photo shown in fig. 3 corresponds to the flat, polished surface of a CRT screen, the right half corresponds to the [[scattering]] anti-glare (AG) layer of an LCD monitor.

The matte light [[scattering]] surface of LCD monitors has two effects:<br />
(1) ambient light sources reflected in the screen are not perceived as a clear image (left side), but rather as a fuzzy area (haze) with increased luminance (right side), and,<br />
(2) while the reflected luminance turns the visual information in the specular direction unreadable in the case of the glossy surface (left side, disability glare), the contrast of the text is reduced but the displayed visual information can still be recognized without problems (right side).

The [[scattering]] AG layer reduces the amount of light reflected in the specular direction thus removing disability glare, but the contrast in the vicinity of the specular direction (i.e. above and below the vertical position of the arrows in fig. 3) is reduced by what is called ""veiling glare"", i.e. a certain amount of reflected luminance outside the specular direction decreasing with angular distance as shown in fig. 4 (center diagram). This added reflected luminance from usually white light (e.g. daylight, room illumination) not only reduces the contrast to a certain extend, it also reduces the saturation of colors displayed on the screen.

The '''[[Visual Appearance|appearance of objects]]''' - their color and surface finish - can be characterized by the way in which they reflect and transmit [[light]] (visible part of the spectrum of electro-magnetic radiation). The color of objects is determined by the parts of the spectrum of light that are reflected or transmitted (i.e. not absorbed), yielding the chromatic aspect of appearance and additional appearance attributes are based on the directional distribution of reflected or transmitted light (e.g. gloss, shiny versus dull, matte) <ref>ASTM Standards on Color & Appearance Measurement</ref>.<br />

[[Electronic-Visual-Displays|Electronic visual display]] screens obviously have quite different reflection properties, a fact that moved into the focus of display ergonimists and [[metrologist]]s in the context of controlling and reducing unwanted display reflections <ref>E. F. Kelley, G. R. Jones, Utilizing the BRDF to predict reflections from FPDs, SID’97 Digest, pp. 831</ref>,<ref>M. E. Becker, Evaluation and Characterization of Display Reflectance, SID'97 Digest, pp. 827</ref>. While CRT monitors combine both Lambertian and specular reflection characteristics (the specular component arises from the front surface of the CRT faceplate and the Lambertian part is caused by the phosphor layer coated to the inner surface of the faceplate) things are different in the case of LCD screens. ISO 13406-2 describes two methods for characterization of the (sometimes anisotropic) reflectance characteristics of LCDs: the use of light sources with different apertures (subtending angles of e.g. 1° and 15°) in a specular configuration <ref>S. Kubota, Measurement of specular reflectance of LCDs, Proc. Int. Symp. Illum. Engin. Soc. Jpn., (1994), pp. 241</ref>, completed by an approximated diffuse illumination and the [[BRDF]] (bi-directional reflectance distribution function) approach <ref>F. E. Nicodemus, et al., Geometric Considerations and Nomenclature for Reflectance, U.S. Dept. of Commerce, NBS Monograph 160 (1977)</ref> as the most comprehensive but very demanding alternative <ref>ISO13406-2 Ergonomic Requirements for Work with Visual Displays Based on Flat Panels-Part 2: Ergonomic Requirements for Flat Panel Displays, Dec 1, 2001</ref>.

The [[BDRF]] of LCD screens with AG coating is generally bell-shaped (see fig. 4B), indicating a non-trivial haze component without any Lambertian contributions <ref>M. E. Becker, Display Reflectance: Basics, measurement and rating, JSID, 14/11(2006), pp. 1003-1017</ref>. Depending on the scattering properties of the AG coating a specular peak may be present as well. LCDs without AG coating still exhibit non-trivial haze but with a substantial specular component, depending on presence and properties of the non-scattering multilayer [[Anti-reflective coating|anti-reflection coating]].
=={{anchor|Mesurement and Characterization of Display Reflectance}}Measurement and Characterization of Display Reflectance==

The reflectance of all kinds of visual displays can be described most comprehensively by the [[BDRF]] (bi-directional reflectance distribution function) from which a variety of reflectance characteristics can be derived (e.g. [[Gloss (material appearance)|gloss]], [[Visual Appearance|haze]], hemispherical reflectance, etc.).

Characterization of the reflective properties of visual displays is a complex field of optical metrology, with elaborate equipment (gonio-photometer, gonio-spectro-radiometer, [[Conoscopy|conoscopic]] instruments, etc.) and lots of pitfalls.

==CRT monitors with AG coating?==
[[Image:Blur-by-Scattering-1307-E.png|thumb|200px|right|Figure 6: The blur induced by a scattering layer (matte glass) increases with the distance between the information (ruler scaling) and the scattering layer. The scattering layer is close to the ruler surface on the left side and the distance increases to the right as does the blur. The condition shown in the upper left corner represents an LCD monitor (scattering layer close to the original visual information) while the condition in the upper right corner represents the blurring that would occur in a CRT monitor with the same scattering AG coating, but at an increased distance from the original visual information (thick faceplate).]]

The question may arise, why such an effective treatment for reduction of reflections was not applied to CRT monitors. When a scattering layer is placed over well defined visual information (e.g. the scaling of the ruler in fig. 4), the definition of the information (lateral contrast) decreases with increasing distance between the initially well defined information and the scattering layer <ref>A. M. Nuijs, J. J. L. Horikx, Diffraction and Scattering at Antiglare Structures for Display Devices, Applied Optics, 33, 18(1994), pp. 4058-4068</ref> as illustrated in fig. 5.

In LCDs the visual information is generated in the LC-layer which is less than 1&nbsp;mm away from the scattering AG coating on the front polarizer. In CRT displays however, the front glass is thick (10&nbsp;mm – 30&nbsp;mm, depending on the size of the tube) to withstand the atmospheric pressure. The visual information is generated by activation of the phosphors that are coated to the inner side of the CRT faceplate via the scanning electron beam.

It is the distance between the original visual information and the location of the scattering AG layer, in the CRT case given by the thickness of the faceplate, that would either blur the displayed information at the same time as reflections are reduced, or the degree of scattering would have to be decreased that much (to avoid blurring) that reflections are not sufficiently reduced. This conflict between image blurring and reduction of reflected light made AG coatings much less effective for CRTs than for LCD screens.

An alternative way to reduce reflections from surfaces uses a stack of smooth dielectric layers with different indices of refraction (usually coated by vacuum processes, see [[anti-reflective coating]]) to realize destructive interference and thus a reduction of the intensity reflected light. While an untreated glass-air interface provides reflections between 4% and 100% (depending on the angle of incidence), anti-reflection coatings can reduce the reflectance from e.g. 4% to 0,4% and below, depending on the efforts involved (i.e. number of dielectric layers).

==Most of the work is not done in a dark room==
Unfortunately, the contrast, being the major measure for the visual performance of a visual display screen and listed in the technical specifications of display screens, is measured under dark room conditions while the actual work is (almost) never carried out in a completely dark environment. Ambient light reflected from the display surface reduces contrast, making the displayed information harder to recognize and decreases the saturation of colors. In surrounds with non-zero illumination it is the reflectivity of a display screen that determines the contrast of the visual information and thus the usability for e.g. computer work. The reflectance characteristics of a display screen consequently define the level of usability and ergonomic performance of display screens.

In most of the working conditions, even when the work is done with mobile computers, the location of light sources that may be origins of reflections in the monitor screen with respect to the monitor cannot be controlled in such a way that it would be possible to completely exclude reflections. To a certain extent rotation of the monitor and adjustment of its tilt angle (i.e. angle of inclination) may help to improve the situation, but as soon as the user is wearing a white blouse or a white shirt, this approach offers quite limited improvements.

The flower was then found by a woman named Mother Goethel, who soon learned that by singing a certain song to the flower, it exuded a power that restored her youth.

Centuries passed, and a kingdom grew and prospered nearby. After sometime, the King and his Wife were expecting their first child, but the Queen was deathly ill, and rumor was that a glowing yellow flower created by a drop of sunlight could cure her. The soldiers of the kingdom searched far and wide, and finally found the flower that Goethel had been hoarding for many years.

Distilling it into an elixir, the Queen was saved, and gave birth to a little girl, though unlike her parents, her hair was a golden color. Giving her the name Rapunzel, the Royal family held a celebration, sending aloft a glowing paper lantern.

Soon finding the source of her youthful restoration taken, Mother Goethel stole into the castle, and upon finding Rapunzel in her crib, recited the song. The girl's hair glowed yellow just like the flower, but when Goethel attempted to clip some hair in hopes to use it to restore her beauty, the clipped hair turned brown, and Goethel then took the young girl with her.

Taking her to a secret tower, Mother Goethel raised the girl to think that she was Rapunzel's mother, teaching her the song and relying on her for youthful restoration. As the years went by, Rapunzel was fascinated by a strange grouping of light that took place on the same day as her Birthday. Unknown to her, the releasing of lanterns is a tradition of the King and Queen, in hopes their daughter will return to them one day.

Over the years, Rapunzel grows into a creative young woman, trying to busy herself stuck in her tower as Mother Goethel comes and goes as she pleases. Rapunzel also befriends a little chameleon named Pascal. Though she claims that she likes staying in her tower, she longs to leave it and see the world, especially the floating lights that occur on her Birthday.

A few days before her Birthday, Mother Goethel visits her, and Rapunzel gets up the nerve to ask Goethel to take her to see the floating lights. Goethel quells Rapunzel's interest by scaring her into thinking that the world is too dangerous for someone as naive as her, and that people will want to capture her for her magic golden hair. Sadly, Rapunzel promises to not ask to leave the tower again.

After Mother Goethel leaves, Rapunzel is shocked when a young man makes his way into the tower. After hitting him over the head with a frying pan and hiding him in her closet, Rapunzel now feels that Mother Goethel was wrong, and that if she was able to subdue a person and put him in a closet, maybe she can take care of herself! However, when Mother Goethel returns and tries to broach the subject again (trying to lead up to revealing the young man in her closet), Mother Goethel loudly proclaims that Rapunzel will never leave the tower.

Quickly, Rapunzel changes the subject, and requests that Mother Goethel get her some seashells to make more white paint with. Mother Goethel is not pleased to make a 3-day journey for this, but does so in hopes that this will turn Rapunzel's mind away from leaving.

After she is gone, Rapunzel releases the young man, and tying him in a chair with her hair, finds that his name is Flynn Rider. Thinking he's been sent to capture her and her hair, Flynn claims he was just looking for a place to hide, having stolen a tiara from the neighboring kingdom. Rapunzel takes his satchel and the tiara contained within, and makes a deal with Flynn: if he will take her to see the floating lanterns and return her to her tower, she will give him back his satchel and the tiara. Reluctantly, Flynn agrees.

After making her way out of the tower, Rapunzel struggles with her emotions: excited to see the world for the first time, but also deeply guilty that she has defied her 'Mother.' Flynn offers to return her, but Rapunzel claims she will be alright.

Hoping to get her to change her mind, Flynn takes her to a place called The Snuggly Duckling, which is overrun with a group of ruffians. However, the ruffians recognize Flynn as a wanted man of the neighboring kingdom, and send one of their associates to alert the Palace Guards. However, Rapunzel pleads with the men to let Flynn go, and how she needs him to fulfill a dream she's had all her life. This melts the hearts of the ruffians, who each reveal dreams of their own.

However, the Palace Guards soon enter, and Rapunzel and Flynn escape through a secret passageway. This leads them to a quarry, where Flynn is soon cornered by the Palace Guards, a Palace horse named Maximus, and two of Flynn's cohorts who he attempted to flee from with the tiara.

As Rapunzel and Flynn attempt to escape, Maximus dislodges a piece of wood from a makeshift dam nearby, attempting to use it to walk over a cliff area...only to have the dam break and flood the area. Rapunzel and Flynn make it into a cave, but are soon trapped when rocks cover the entrance, and water from the broken dam begins to fill up the empty space. Feeling that they may soon die, the two then confess a secret to the other: Flynn reveals that his real name is Eugene Fitzherbert, and Rapunzel reveals that her hair glows when she sings. Realizing this can work to their advantage, she quickly sings, and the illumination from her hair allows Flynn to dislodge some of the rocks at the entrace, and the two escape.

Meanwhile, Mother Gothel has returned from her journey early, and having found Rapunzel gone from the tower, but the satchel and tiara there along with a wanted poster of Flynn, sets out to bring her 'daughter' back. Arming herself with a dagger and trailing the two to the Snuggly Duckling, she soon learns that they have escaped through a tunnel, and manages to find where the tunnel ends. When she gets there, she instead finds Flynn's two cohorts. Hoping to use them to her advantage, she gives them back the satchel and tiara that Flynn had, but claims she knows of something worth much more, and can also help them exact revenge on Flynn Rider.

As night settles, Flynn and Rapunzel camp for the night, and Rapunzel uses her hair to heal a wound on Flynn's hand from the escape. As they talk, Flynn reveals why he does not go by his given name of Eugene. As an orphan, he was entranced by stories of a thief named Flynn, and the daring to have enough money to go anywhere he wanted intrigued him. Even so, Rapunzel claims that she likes the name Eugene better.

After Flynn goes off to get some more wood for their fire, Mother Goethel appears to Rapunzel, and intends to take her back to the tower. However, Rapunzel refuses to go. When she claims that she thinks Flynn likes her, Goethel reveals the tiara and satchel, claiming that's all Flynn really cares for. Goethel gives these to Rapunzel and tells her to give them to Flynn to prove her right.

Fearing that Goethel is telling the truth, Rapunzel hides the items when he returns, and they settle in for the night, with Goethel and Flynn's former cohorts watching from a distance.

The next day, the horse Maximus finally tracks down Flynn, intending to turn him in. However, Rapunzel convinces Maximus that she needs Flynn to show her the lanterns, and the horse gives in to her 24-hour reprieve. The group then makes their way to the nearby kingdom, where Rapunzel has her hair weaved into an extra-large braid to keep it from getting trampled, and views an intricate tile portrait of the Royal family, including a blonde baby girl.

As the day wears on, Rapunzel and Flynn grow closer together until it's time for the lantern ceremony. The two take a boat out onto the nearby waters, and are in awe as the lanterns cast a romantic setting upon the water. Rapunzel then reveals the satchel and tiara, but unlike what Goethel told her, Flynn does not seem to care about these. As they watch the lanterns , they then confess their feelings for the other, but before they can kiss, Flynn spots his cohorts on the nearby shore.

Bringing the boat to shore, Flynn meets his cohorts, and apologizes for his actions, giving them the satchel and the tiara. However, they now claim they don't want it.

As she waits by the boat, Rapunzel is shocked when the two cohorts approach her, and point out a boat sailing towards the kingdom, with Flynn at the wheel. The two claim he took the crown and left, leaving them to capture Rapunzel and her magical hair. Rapunzel attempts to flee, but is saved when Mother Goethel appears, knocking out the two men. Rapunzel then returns with her Mother, promising never to disobey her again.

In reality, the two men knocked out Flynn, and lashed him and the tiara to the wheel of the ship. As it arrives at the kingdom's port, Flynn is arrested.

Back in her tower, Mother Goethel sends Rapunzel to her room, claiming they'll forget everything that happened. However, as she looks around her room and at the sun emblem of the kingdom she obtained while she was there, Rapunzel notices that within a number of her drawings, the same symbol occurs, and she suddenly realizes that she is the missing Princess for whom the lanterns are for!

Rapunzel goes to Mother Goethel wanting to know the truth. Realizing that she has been lied to all her life, Rapunzel attempts to leave but not before Goethel stops her from going after Flynn, claiming that he has by now been captured by the Palace Guards who most likely will execute him as soon as possible.

In the kingdom, Flynn is led to the gallows, but stops when he comes across his cohorts, wanting to know what they did to Rapunzel. They claim they were acting under the order of Mother Goethel to get Rapunzel back.

As Flynn is about to be led into the courtyard gallows, The ruffians from the Snuggly Duckling along with Maximus break Flynn out. Maximus then helps Flynn return to the tower.

When Rapunzel's hair ascends to the ground, Flynn climbs up it, but is shocked when he sees Rapunzel bound and gagged, and is soon stabbed by Goethel with a dagger. Goethel then leaves Flynn to die, trying to drag Rapunzel out another exit, promising to take her somewhere where noone will find her.

As she struggles watching Flynn in pain, Rapunzel promises she will go with Goethel without resistance, if she can use her magic hair to save Flynn.

Goethel agrees, but chains Flynn to keep him from getting away. Flynn begs Rapunzel not to do this, saying that her promise will never allow her to be free. As she attempts to recite the magic incantation, Flynn gets hold of a broken piece of the nearby vanity mirror, cutting off Rapunzel's long hair, breaking its enchantment.

This then causes Mother Goethel to age quickly, driving her into a state of shock that causes her to fall out the nearby window. Aging several centuries in a matter of seconds, her cloak then hits the forest floor, and all that remains of the vain woman is a a cloud of dust.

As Rapunzel watches, Flynn dies in her arms. Her eyes filled with tears, she finishes reciting the incantation, even though her hair has now turned to a more natural brown color. However, as a tear falls on Flynn's face, the last magic of the sunflower restores Flynn to health, and the two lovers unite in a kiss.

Flynn and Rapunzel then return to the kingdom, where Rapunzel is reunited with her parents. Flynn is welcomed into the family, and after a celebration to mark the return of the Princess (in which we see that the ruffians have also fulfilled their own dreams), it is revealed that eventually, Flynn (aka Eugene) and Rapunzel were married soon after.

Years later, the queen of a nearby kingdom falls ill while expecting a child. Her guards find the mysterious flower, which heals the queen and she gives birth to a girl named [[Princess Rapunzel (Disney)|Rapunzel]]. Gothel learns that Rapunzel's golden hair retains the flower's healing abilities as long as it isn't cut, so she kidnaps the child and isolates her in a tower, raising the girl as her own daughter. However, every year on Rapunzel's birthday, the kingdom sends thousands of [[Sky lantern|floating lanterns]] into the sky longing for their lost princess to return. 

Eighteen years later, Rapunzel lives in the tower with her pet [[chameleon]], Pascal. Rapunzel asks Gothel to let her see the floating lights on her birthday, but Gothel denies her request, saying the world is full of people who would covet her abilities for themselves. Meanwhile, thieves led by Flynn Rider, steal the tiara of the missing princess from the castle. Flynn abandons his accomplices and stumbles upon Rapunzel's tower, choosing it as a hideout. During the chase, the lead guard's horse, Maximus, is separated from his rider and continues the search for Flynn on his own. Once inside the tower, Flynn is knocked unconscious by Rapunzel, who then hides him in a dresser. 

Rapunzel tells Gothel that she wants a special paint for her birthday. Gothel agrees, and after she leaves, Rapunzel makes a deal with Flynn — if he escorts her to the lights and back, she will return the tiara. While Rapunzel is excited to be free, she is soon conflicted between her freedom and her guilt of disobedience. While traveling, the two visit the Snuggly Duckling Tavern, which appears to be full of thugs like Gothel warned Rapunzel about, but they all each have their own dreams, just as Rapunzel does. As the royal guards continue their search, Gothel learns of the pursuit, returns to the tower and finds Rapunzel gone. The tavern regulars help the pair escape from the guards, but they eventually corner Flynn at a man-made dam, which Maximus inadvertently causes to collapse. Trapped in a flooding cave, Rapunzel reveals her powers to Flynn, which enables them to escape safely, and Flynn reveals his real name, Eugene Fitzherbert, and his reason for being a thief. While Flynn gathers firewood, Gothel secretly meets with Rapunzel, who tells Gothel she has feelings for Flynn. Gothel says he's only after the tiara, and that Rapunzel should give it to him as a test.

The next morning, Maximus confronts Flynn again, but Rapunzel befriends the horse and the group travels together to the royal kingdom. That night, Rapunzel gives Flynn the tiara, but he realizes as they watch the lanterns that it's Rapunzel he wants. Seeing his former accomplices, Flynn attempts to give them the tiara, but the pair are now working with Gothel. They make it appear that Flynn is escaping with the tiara, and Gothel, betraying the thieves, ""rescues"" the heartbroken Rapunzel and takes her back to the tower. Flynn, sentenced to be hanged for his crimes, learns of the treachery from the captured henchmen. The Snuggly Duckling regulars rescue Flynn and deliver him to Maximus, who takes him to the tower to find Rapunzel.

Meanwhile, Rapunzel realizes that she is actually the long-lost princess, and she confronts Gothel with the revelation. Flynn reaches the tower, but upon entering, he sees the bound Rapunzel and is stabbed by Gothel. Rapunzel pledges to remain with Gothel forever if she can heal Flynn's wounds. Gothel agrees, but Flynn, saying that he would rather die than have her trapped forever, cuts off Rapunzel's long hair, destroying its healing power. Gothel screams in horror as her true age begins to catch up to her, and as she writhes, trips on Rapunzel's hair and falls out of the tower window, turning to dust before she hits the ground. Flynn reveals his love for Rapunzel, and succumbs to his wounds. Heartbroken, she tearfully tries to sing the incantation as a single tear lands on his cheek and miraculously heals him. The group returns to the castle, where the royal family is reunited at last. In time, Flynn and Rapunzel get married, and live happily ever after as the pub thugs fulfill their individual aspirations, and Maximus becomes a respected official on the Royal Guard.

Many years later, Bruce wakes up in a prison in [[Bhutan]] and is approached by [[Henri Ducard]], who witnessed him brutally beat six other inmates who were all more than twice his size. Ducard invites him to join the League of Shadows, led by [[Ra's al Ghul]]. When Bruce first enters the league's home, Ducard suddenly attacks him to test his ability. Ducard notices that Bruce is afraid, but not of him. Bruce then remembers his father helping him get out of the cave he fell into when he was ten. That night, he and his parents went to an opera, but the characters in the show reminded him of the bats who attacked him, so he asks his father to leave out of fear. They leave through a back exit that leads to an alley, where a homeless mugger name Joe Chill shoots both of them and then runs away. Bruce's father tells him not to be afraid, then Bruce watches in horror as both of his parents die.

Years later, Bruce returns to Gotham City from [[Princeton University]] because a hearing is being held to grant Chill early parole in order to testify against [[Carmine Falcone]], Gotham's most powerful and dangerous crime lord. After the judge grants Chill early parole, Bruce attempts to approach him in order to shoot him, but one of Falcone's thugs shoot Chill first. Rachel, who now works in Gotham's District Attorney office, explains to Bruce that Falcone is destroying everything his parents stood for, and that all officials are either too scared to do anything about it or are on Falcone's payroll. Bruce tells her that he was planning to kill Chill, and she slaps him and tells him his father would be ashamed. Bruce then approaches Falcone to tell him that not everyone in Gotham is afraid of him, and Falcone tells him that because of Bruce's wealth and social status, he doesn't understand why everyone fears him. Bruce then runs away to [[Asia]] so he could be somewhere where no one knows who he is and learn about poverty and the criminal mind. He is arrested for assisting in a robbery, which leads up to the events of the beginning.

In present day, Ducard finishes training Bruce, and he tells him that he must complete one last task- to execute a murderer who was being held in custody by the league. Bruce refuses, and is then told by Ra's al Ghul that he needs to kill him in order to lead the league into Gotham to destroy it. To keep them from destroying his home, he burns down their castle, but not before watching Ra's al Ghul die and rescuing Ducard from the burning building. Bruce returns to Gotham, and his butler, [[Alfred Pennyworth]], tells him that the CEO of his father's company, William Earle, had Bruce pronounced dead so he'd be able to run the company the way he wanted and take it public. Bruce then lets Alfred know about his plan to become a symbol to restore hope to the citizens of Gotham by establishing fear in the criminals and corrupt officials of the city. 

Once he returns, Bruce finds out that [[Scarecrow (comics) | Dr. Jonathan Crane]], a phycologist who runs [[Arkham Asylum]], is being paid by Falcone to declare his thugs insane to save them trips to prison, and that the only person who suspects this is Rachel, who Crane wants Falcone to have killed. Bruce gets a battle suit, weaponry, and a war car called the Tumbler from his colleaue at Wayne Enterprises, [[Lucius Fox]]. Bruce, using the alias Batman, stops Falcone from taking in a shipment of illegal drugs and leaves him and his men to be arrested by the Gotham police. Batman then stops Falcone's thugs from killing Rachel before giving her evidence of the wrongdoings of some officials on Falcone's payroll. 

Batman gains the trust of [[James Gordon (comics) | Sgt. Jim Gordon]], who is one of very few honest cops on the police force. Batman tells Gordon that his parter, Sgt. Flask, is working with Falcone. Batman then interrogates Flask to find out about the drugs that were being shipped to Falcone. Crane visits Falcone in prison because he is pleading insane to get out of going to prison. Crane exposes him to a toxin he created that instills fear into its victims. Under the influence of the toxins, Falcone screams in fear, and Crane declares him insane and has him moved to Arkham.

Batman goes after Crane, but is exposed to his toxin and set on fire before being picked up by Alfred. Bruce wakes up two days later because of a cure to the gas created by Fox. Rachel tells Bruce that she is going to confront Crane because he had Falcone moved to Arkham, so he follows her as Batman to protect her from Crane's toxins. He is unable to stop Crane from exposing her to the toxins, however, so he exposes Crane to it himself and asks him who he is working for, to which Crane replies ""Ra's al Ghul"", which confuses Bruce. Once the police arrive to arrest Batman, Sgt. Gordon helps him and Rachel escape. After a high speed car chase with the police, Batman takes Rachel back to his cave and gives her the antidote created by Fox. 

At Bruce's birthday party that night, he is told by Fox that the toxins created by Crane could be used to expose onto an entire city if used by a microwave emitter like the one that was just stolen from Wayne Enterprises. Later at the party, Bruce is approached by Ducard, who reveals himself to be the real Ra's al Ghul. Ra's tells Bruce that he is going to use Crane's toxins and the microwave emitter to poison Gotham's water supply and destroy the city. He knocks Bruce unconcious and sets fire to his mansion. Alfred gets Bruce into the cave just before the mansion burns down, and once Bruce is about to give up hope on himself, Alfred reminds him of something his father taught him when he was a kid, which motivates him to stop Ra's. 

Ra's has all of the inmates at Arkham released, which causes a huge riot, especially after everyone on the island of Arkham is exposed to the toxins, except for Gordon and Rachel, who were given antidotes by Batman. Just when Gordon thinks he is on his own in stopping the disaster, Batman shows up and tells him what Ra's is planning to do, and that he'll be using the train to get to the water supply. Batman goes after the train while Gordon drives the Tumbler to the tracks to try and destroy the tracks to prevent the train from getting to the water supply. 

After saving Rachel from Crane, who was one of the escaped inmates from Arkham, Bruce reveals his identity to her. He then goes after the train that Ra's is on, and fights him while Gordon is finally able to shoot down the tracks. Bruce separates Ra's' train from the rest of the train and leaves him to die. Ra's accepts his fate, respecting Bruce and the fact that he used everything he taught him against him. 

The next day, Batman is hailed by the public as a hero. Bruce fires Earle and has him replaced by Fox. Rachel approaches Bruce and tells him that she loves him. They kiss, but she tells him that as long as he is Batman, they can never be together, but she will wait for him once the day comes that Gotham no longer needs Batman. Gordon, now a leuitenant, calls Batman to police headquarters using a newly formed bat-signal and tells him that a murderer is on the loose who leaves a Joker playing-card as a calling card. Batman tells him he'll look into it before disappearing into the night.",,"A young [[Bruce Wayne]] falls down a well and is attacked by bats. Bruce then awakens from this nightmare of his past and is revealed to be a prisoner in [[Bhutan]]. He is approached by [[Henri Ducard]], who speaks for [[Ra's al Ghul]], leader of the [[League of Assassins|League of Shadows]], and invites him to train with the elite vigilante group. The narrative returns to Bruce's childhood, to the fateful night he witnessed his parents' murder by a mugger named [[Joe Chill]]. Chill is later arrested and Bruce is taken home and raised by the family [[butler]] [[Alfred Pennyworth]].

Years later, Bruce returns to [[Gotham City]] from [[Princeton University]], intent on killing Chill, whose prison sentence is being suspended in exchange for testifying against crime boss [[Carmine Falcone]]. Before he can act, however, one of Falcone's female assassins posing as a reporter kills Chill. [[Rachel Dawes]], Bruce's childhood friend and now an assistant [[district attorney]], is disgusted with Bruce's intent, telling him his father would be ashamed of him. That night, Bruce confronts Falcone, who tells the young man that his criminal empire is invincible because it runs on fear. Inspired, Bruce decides to travel the world for several years, learning the various ways of the criminal underworld, before himself becoming a criminal and being arrested. After Bruce's training in the League of Shadows, Ra's and Ducard tell Bruce his purpose: He must lead the League to destroy Gotham, which they believe is corrupt beyond saving. Bruce refuses to become a murderer and battles Ra's, burning the temple in the process, before making his escape. Ra's is killed by falling debris, but Bruce saves an unconscious Ducard and returns to Gotham.

Falcone now dominates the city. Bruce enlists the help of Sgt. [[James Gordon (comics)|Jim Gordon]], one of the city's few honest police officers, and befriends [[Lucius Fox]], a former board member of [[Wayne Enterprises]]. Fox helps Bruce acquire a [[Batmobile|prototype armored car]] and an [[Batsuit|experimental armored suit]]. With Alfred, Bruce finds another entrance to the cave under the well and creates [[Batcave|a workshop]], modifying his equipment to take up the identity of Batman. On his first night out as a vigilante, he intercepts a drug shipment, captures Falcone and provides Rachel with the evidence to [[indictment|indict]] him. Falcone and his men are transferred to [[Arkham Asylum]] with the help of the hospital's corrupt administrator, [[Scarecrow (comics)|Dr. Jonathan Crane]], who has been paying off Falcone to ship a toxic [[hallucinogen]]ic into Gotham City; Crane uses the toxin in his experiments, using his patients as guinea pigs. When Falcone demands a bigger share, Crane gasses Falcone with the same toxin, literally driving him insane with fear. While investigating the drugs, Batman encounters Crane, who also sprays him with the fear toxin. Alfred rescues him, using an anti-toxin developed by Fox. Crane later summons Rachel to Arkham and shows her that the toxin has been introduced into Gotham's water supply from Arkham for weeks, and then infects her. Batman doses Crane with the toxin, saves Rachel, and then takes her to his cave giving her vials for Gordon: One for inoculating himself and the other for mass production.

At Bruce's birthday celebration at [[Wayne Manor]], he is confronted by Ducard, who reveals himself to be the real Ra's al Ghul, and has now arrived in Gotham personally to destroy the city; he had conspired with Crane to poison Gotham's water supply with the toxin, vaporizing it with a stolen device from Wayne Enterprises. After Bruce pretends to be drunk to get everyone to leave, he and Ra's fight. Ra's' men burn down the mansion, release all the inmates at Arkham, and vaporize the hallucinogen into the atmosphere. Although Wayne Manor is destroyed, Bruce escapes the inferno with help from Alfred. Rachel delivers the antidote to Gordon and wards off Crane, now calling himself Scarecrow, with a [[taser]]. Batman reveals his identity to Rachel and then has Gordon drive the Batmobile to Wayne Tower, the central hub of the Gotham elevated rail system. Ra's boards the train; his objective is to reach Wayne Tower with the vaporizer as it is also a major water hub. As Batman confronts Ra's on the train, Gordon destroys the elevated tracks. Batman jams the controls and escapes the train as it crashes, leaving Ra's to die.

Following the battle, Batman becomes a public hero and Bruce gains control of his company; he fires the former CEO, William Earle, and replaces him with Lucius Fox. However, he loses Rachel, who cannot bring herself to love both Bruce and Batman. Gordon, now a Lieutenant, shows Batman the [[Bat-Signal]] and mentions a [[Joker (comics)|new criminal]] who leaves [[Joker (playing card)|Joker playing cards]] at crime scenes.

Farmfoods predominately sells [[frozen food]] and also grocery items. 
Farmfoods is a privately-owned business in the [[United Kingdom]]. The brand has been voted one of Scotland's fastest growing businesses.<ref>http://business.scotsman.com/6983/Farmfoods-boss-buys-brothers-21.2589327.jp</ref> 
Farmfoods originated as an [[Aberdeen]]-based meat manufacturing business. Farmfoods then began to freeze products to enable a wider geographical distribution to catering outlets. The firm expanded to dispatched products further afield, to  Scottish cities like [[Glasgow]] and [[Edinburgh]] and with growth, further lines by larger manufacturers such as [[McCain Foods Limited|McCain]] were introduced.
By 1975 the entire business had changed its focus from manufacture distributor/wholesale on frozen food retail. An experimental [[freezer centre]] was set up in Aberdeen. A further 10 freezer centres were opened across Scotland and Farmfoods in its current format was formed.
In the early 1990s, Farmfoods expanded further with the acquisition of the Capital Freezer Centres chain as well as a few smaller freezer centre chains across the country. By 2005, Farmfoods operated more than 300 specialist freezer centres across the UK.
Farmfoods stores are typically located in [[city centre|city and town centres]], usually in stand-alone units, with some stores are located in [[shopping centre]]s. However, recently Farmfoods have started to focus on out-of-town facilities.
The whole of the Farmfoods chain falls into three regions. These being Blairlinn, [[Warrington]] and [[Monkspath]]. In addition to the standard lines offered across the chain, some stores will also offer local produce. 
Generally, stores are in the form of aisles with waist-height freezer cabinets running along each side and shelving above most freezers. 
Recently the company has developed a standard wheelchair-accessible layout for its new stores.
Among other changes made to store entrances this involved the removal of trolly flaps and turn-style entry systems that many stores of this style previously had fitted as a security measure. This move made the stores conform to the relevant disability accessibility regulations.
In 2005 Farmfoods changed the maximum height of shelving in all of its stores. This was a reaction to a number of staff-related accidents relating to staff either falling off cabinets or falling through the glass lids while attempting to stock the higher shelves. Farmfoods' response to thie rate of accidents was to place a poster on all staff noticeboards, highlighting the dangers of standing on freezer lids and stating this practice was strictly forbidden by the business.
Smaller stores tend to have two-four checkouts with space for a customer to place a basket onto the checkout for the cashier to access as they [[Barcode|scan]] each item. The company is currently installing conveyor belt driven checkout areas and upgrading its stores so that all can accept credit and debit cards.
Farmfoods stores typically employ few people. The chain aims to offer products cheaper than [[Iceland (supermarket)|Iceland]]. 
The chain also carries one-off special promotions on short-dated, end of line and promotional goods throughout all of its ranges.
Many sections of Farmfoods stores are grouped by the item's price (for example ""This Section 25p Each"". These price-banded sections are ordinarily 25p, 45p, 59p, 69p, 89p and £1. Products outside of these price brackets, above £1 value are normally rounded to quarters of the pound value.
Although the company continues to focus on providing frozen food, in recent years it has developed a range of  grocery items. There is a mix of branded and in-house brand or own-brand goods. The chain also owns a number of in-house brands.",,"'''Farmfoods''' is a [[discounts and allowances|discount]] [[supermarket]] chain in the [[United Kingdom]]. Farmfoods specialise in [[frozen food]] but also offer an extensive range of everyday essentials and grocery items such as soft drinks, [[toilet paper]], [[confectionery]], bread, milk, desserts, fresh fruit and vegetables.
Farmfoods is one of the most successful privately-owned businesses in the [[United Kingdom]] having operated profitably for over 50 years. There are relatively few, successful companies on the high street that remain in private ownership. Farmfoods is one of them; other well-known examples include [[discounts and allowances|discount]] chains [[Wilkinson (retailer)|Wilkinson]], Mackay's, [[B & M|B & M Bargains]] and [[TJ Morris]] (who trade as [[Home Bargains]] in most locations).

Farmfoods roots go back to being an [[Aberdeen]]-based meat manufacturing business. Farmfoods then began to freeze products to enable a wider geographical distribution to catering outlets. Steadily, products were dispatched further afield, to major Scottish cities like [[Glasgow]] and [[Edinburgh]] and with growth, further lines by larger manufacturers such as chips by [[McCain Foods Limited|McCain]] were introduced, this, over the chain's development expanded into many of the usual household names known today such as [[Weight Watchers]], [[Tetley Tea]], [[HP Foods]] and [[H. J. Heinz Company|Heinz]] among numerous others.
By 1975 the entire business had changed its focus from manufacture distributor/wholesale on frozen food retail. An experimental [[freezer centre]] was set up in Aberdeen and, over a number of years proved very successful. A further 10 freezer centres were opened across Scotland and Farmfoods, in its current format was formed.
In the early 1990s, Farmfoods expanded further with the acquisition of the Capital Freezer Centres chain as well as a few smaller freezer centre chains across the country. By 2005, Farmfoods operates more than 300 specialist freezer centres stretching from [[Invergordon]] in the [[North of Scotland]] to Dover in the [[South East of England]].
Farmfoods stores are typically located in [[city centre|city and town centres]], more-often-than-not in stand-alone units with their own free car parking, however occasionally stores are located in [[shopping centre]]s. However, recently Farmfoods have started to focus on opening stores near the edge of towns, where they have their own larger car parks and are able to open for longer periods.
== Store re-branding 2009 ==
The entire chain underwent a complete rebranding exercise during the first two quarters of 2009. These are now nearing their completion in the southern regions and have been completed in Scottish areas as well as the [[North of England]]. The chain is relaunching to be less of a ""hardcore discounter"" to more of a [[middle class]] ""great value"" brand. With this, the varying shades of blue in stores, and bags resembling those of 1970s [[Tesco]] carriers are gone. These are all to be replaced by blacks and greens. The Farmfoods logo itself is now re-enforced by a sunny farm scene which can be seen in all stores on everything from shopfront signs and car park signs to freezers, uniforms and bags (the latter two are being rolled out)

As of 2009 the company's slogan has changed from ""Where Customers Count"", which was used for a number of years, to a combination of two ""Freezing in the Goodness"" and ""Great Food at Amazing Prices"". These new slogans are also strongly re-enforced in the chains re-branded stores, leaflets, bags and television adverts.

Sun 9:00-18:00 (10:00-16:00 in some stores)

The whole of the Farmfoods chain falls into three ""regions"". These being Blairlinn, [[Warrington]] and [[Monkspath]]. Depending on the trading focus in each of these areas store positioning, in-store layouts and focus lines (blockier items in-store) tend to vary slightly based on the preferential regional tastes of the geographical area. For example, stores in [[Staffordshire]] stock the locally produced oatcakes where stores outside of this area wouldn't and may stock their own locality's specialities.
Generally, stores are in the form of aisles with waist-height freezer cabinets running along each side and shelving above most freezers. Popular items, such as soft drinks and canned foods are often stack in the middle on aisles but is now in the middle of a refit to stop middle aisle stacks and have items on the shelves to make more room for customers.
There are many exceptions to this generalisation as all stores are unique. Some stores have sections with full height shelving.  These full height shelving units more-often-than-not house groups of products such as pet foods or toilet paper and other household items. Across the design of each shop had been tailored to the general layout of the store. Since many of the older stores were not built to be freezer centres they are often too small and awkwardly shaped making them hard to traverse.  Recently the company has developed a standard wheelchair friendly layout which all the new and much larger stores, such as [[Cumbernauld]], [[Cambuslang]], Sutton and [[Coatbridge]] all conform to.
Older stores were in 2005 adapted and had their previous layouts altered to make movement around the stores easier and more pleasant. Among other changes made to store entrances this involved the removal of trolly flaps and turn-style entry systems that many stores of this style previously had fitted as a security measure. Not only did this move make the stores conform to the relevant disability accessibility regulations but they also made the stores more open and welcoming it also allowed the free-flowing movement of trolleys from the shop itself to vehicles located in the car park.
In 2005 Farmfoods changed the maximum height of shelving in all of its stores. This was a reaction to a number of staff-related accidents relating to staff either falling off cabinets or falling through the glass lids while attempting to stock the higher shelves. This time a poster was placed on all staff notice boards highlighting the dangers of standing on freezer lids and stating this practice was strictly forbidden by the business.
Smaller stores tend to have two-four checkouts with space for a customer to place a basket onto the checkout for the cashier to access as they [[Barcode|scan]] each item. The company is currently installing conveyor belt driven checkout areas, improved scanning and card acceptance facilities across all stores. The new conveyor belt systems provide considerably more space to place scanned items and allow the checkout experience to be more streamlined for customers with trolleys as they are not required to lift shopping to the checkout as they are served. Improved scanning facilities allow for a faster checkout experience and faster, fixed credit/[[debit card]] acceptance facilities will shortly be rolled out across all stores. All new stores opened by the company as of autumn 2007 have these new checkout facilities.

Farmfoods stores are typically between 6000-9000 Sq. ft <ref>http://www.farmfoods.co.uk/index.php?p=property</ref>
Farmfoods stores typically employ few people. The chain aims to offer products cheaper than [[Iceland (supermarket)|Iceland]]. Recently the business has been looking to alter its trading stance slightly; previously trading in some goods running a little close to their best before dates (BBEs), however with most supermarket chains now maintaining their profit margins using this method (as a means to purchase goods from suppliers at a lower price) farmfoods are now also looking to move out of the league of ""hardcore"" discounter, such as [[Netto (store)|Netto]], to up its game and reposition itself as a ""great value"" food and essentials retailer - where the perception by customers is one of ""good value and good products"" rather than ""cheap and nasty""
The chain will also continue to carry one-off special promotions on short-dated, end of line and promotional goods throughout all of its ranges.
All items are individually priced, and many have a multi-buy price (for example, 29p or 5 for £1) and other such offers like ''""buy one, get one free""'' (BOGOF). Many sections of Farmfoods stores are grouped by the item's price (for example ""This Section 25p Each"" - a policy which is proven to be a popular one but at the same time ever disappearing from the British high street. These price-banded sections are ordinarily 25p, 45p, 59p, 69p, 89p and £1. Products outside of these price brackets, above £1 value are normally rounded to quarters of the pound value - EG: £1.25, £1.50, £1.75, £2.00, £2.25 etc...
Although the company continues to focus on providing frozen food, in recent years it has developed a large range of complementary grocery items. There is a mix of branded and in-house brand or own-brand goods. A few of the brands stocked are [[H. J. Heinz Company|Heinz]], [[Weight Watchers]], [[McCain Foods Limited|McCain]], [[HP Foods]] and [[Princes (company)|Princes]] among others. The chain also owned a number of in-house brand names, exclusive to Farmfoods stores, along with their own brand lines.

Actually Houdini is an unofficial current blitz champion agreed by all computer chess engine testing websites and amateur testers, at least 50 Elo better than her rivals, however there are still very few testers for long time control and is still controversial in there.
The style of Houdini is aggressive and dynamic, where the default contempt value by author is 1 (0 is neutral and 2 is very aggressive). Houdini sometimes sacrifices pawns for the compensation in development and mobility of pieces, which is unique feature of Houdini.  Houdini can be regarded as a modified engine of Robolito, Ivanhoe and IPPOLIT family (assumption of most chess testers and also admit by the author). According to the author, the engine has several multiples of lines of codes than that of original family engines. The node count speed and evaluation are somewhat similar to that of  IPPOLIT family engines which have several times better in speed and depth evaluation performance than Rybka 4( The most successful  commercial engine in current computer chess tournaments).

Bugs's second appearance in Jones's ''[[Elmer's Pet Rabbit]]'' introduces the audience to the name Bugs Bunny, which until then had only been used among the Termite Terrace employees. It was also the first short where he received billing under his now-famous name, but the card, ""featuring Bugs Bunny"", was just slapped on the end of the completed short's opening titles when ''A Wild Hare'' proved an unexpected success. The rabbit here is in look and voice identical to the one in Jones' earlier ''Elmer's Candid Camera''. 

Bugs in his ''Wild Hare'' likeness appeared in five more shorts during 1941. ''[[Tortoise Beats Hare]]'', directed by Tex Avery, features the first appearance of [[Cecil Turtle]]; ''[[Hiawatha's Rabbit Hunt]]'', is the first Bugs Bunny short directed by [[Friz Freleng]]; ''[[All This and Rabbit Stew]]'', directed by Avery, has Bugs tracked by a little African-American hunter (based heavily on racial stereotypes); ''[[The Heckling Hare]]'' was the final Bugs short Avery worked on before being fired (Avery and producer Schlesinger vehemently disagreed over the ending gag of The Heckling Hare, and Avery refused to compromise his creative principles) and leaving for [[MGM]]; and ''[[Wabbit Twouble]]'', the first Bugs short directed by [[Robert Clampett]]. ''Wabbit Twouble'' was also the first of five Bugs shorts to feature a chubbier remodel of Elmer Fudd, a short-lived attempt to have Fudd more closely resemble his voice actor, comedian [[Arthur Q. Bryan]].",True,16,0
